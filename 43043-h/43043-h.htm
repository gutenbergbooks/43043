<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>With the materials in my hands I have endeavored to
form an <i>autobiography</i> (if the term may be permitted) of
George Eliot. The life has been allowed to write itself
in extracts from her letters and journals. Free from the
obtrusion of any mind but her own, this method serves, I
think, better than any other open to me, to show the development
of her intellect and character.</p>

<p>In dealing with the correspondence I have been influenced
by the desire to make known the woman, as well
as the author, through the presentation of her daily life.</p>

<p>On the intellectual side there remains little to be
learned by those who already know George Eliot's books.
In the twenty volumes which she wrote and published in
her lifetime will be found her best and ripest thoughts.
The letters now published throw light on another side of
her nature&mdash;not less important, but hitherto unknown to
the public&mdash;the side of the affections.</p>

<p>The intimate life was the core of the root from which
sprung the fairest flowers of her inspiration. Fame came
to her late in life, and, when it presented itself, was so
weighted with the sense of responsibility that it was in
truth a rose with many thorns, for George Eliot had the
temperament that shrinks from the position of a public
character. The belief in the wide, and I may add in the
beneficent, effect of her writing was no doubt the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
happiness, the reward of the artist which she greatly
cherished: but the joys of the hearthside, the delight in
the love of her friends, were the supreme pleasures in her
life.</p>

<p>By arranging all the letters and journals so as to form
one connected whole, keeping the order of their dates,
and with the least possible interruption of comment, I
have endeavored to combine a narrative of day-to-day
life, with the play of light and shade which only letters,
written in various moods, can give, and without which no
portrait can be a good likeness. I do not know that the
particular method in which I have treated the letters has
ever been adopted before. Each letter has been pruned
of everything that seemed to me irrelevant to my purpose&mdash;of
everything that I thought my wife would have
wished to be omitted. Every sentence that remains adds,
in my judgment, something (however small it may be) to
the means of forming a conclusion about her character.
I ought perhaps to say a word of apology for what may
appear to be undue detail of travelling experiences; but
I hope that to many readers these will be interesting, as
reflected through George Eliot's mind. The remarks on
works of art are only meant to be records of impressions.
She would have deprecated for herself the attitude of an
art critic.</p>

<p>Excepting a slight introductory sketch of the girlhood,
up to the time when letters became available, and a few
words here and there to elucidate the correspondence, I
have confined myself to the work of selection and arrangement.</p>

<p>I have refrained almost entirely from quoting remembered
sayings by George Eliot, because it is difficult to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
certain of complete accuracy, and everything depends
upon accuracy. Recollections of conversation are seldom
to be implicitly trusted in the absence of notes made at
the time. The value of spoken words depends, too, so
much upon the <em>tone</em>, and on the circumstances which gave
rise to their utterance, that they often mislead as much
as they enlighten, when, in the process of repetition, they
have taken color from another mind. "All interpretations
depend upon the interpreter," and I have judged it
best to let George Eliot be her own interpreter, as far as
possible.</p>

<p>I owe thanks to Mr. Isaac Evans, the brother of my
wife, for much of the information in regard to her child-life;
and the whole book is a long record of debts due to
other friends for letters. It is not, therefore, necessary for
me to recapitulate the list of names in this place. My
thanks to all are heartfelt. But there is a very special
acknowledgment due to Miss Sara Hennell, to Mrs. Bray,
and to the late Mr. Charles Bray of Coventry, not only
for the letters which they placed at my disposal, but also
for much information given to me in the most friendly
spirit. The very important part of the life from 1842 to
1854 could not possibly have been written without their
contribution.</p>

<p>To Mr. Charles Lewes, also, I am indebted for some
valuable letters and extracts from the journals of his
father, besides the letters addressed to himself. He also
obtained for me an important letter written by George
Eliot to Mr. R. H. Hutton; and throughout the preparation
of the book I have had the advantage of his sympathetic
interest, and his concurrence in the publication of
all the materials.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Special thanks are likewise due to Messrs. Wm. Blackwood
&amp; Sons for having placed at my disposal George
Eliot's long correspondence with the firm. The letters
(especially those addressed to her friend the late Mr.
John Blackwood) throw a light, that could not otherwise
have been obtained, on the most interesting part of her
literary career.</p>

<p>To the legal representatives of the late Charles Dickens,
of the late Lord Lytton, and of Mrs. Carlyle; to Mr.
J. A. Froude, and to Mr. Archer Gurney, I owe thanks for
leave to print letters written by them.</p>

<p>For all the defects that there may be in the plan of
these volumes I alone am responsible. The lines were
determined and the work was substantially put into
shape before I submitted the manuscript to any one.
While passing the winter in the south of France I had
the good fortune at Cannes to find, in Lord Acton, not
only an enthusiastic admirer of George Eliot, but also a
friend always most kindly ready to assist me with valuable
counsel and with cordial, generous sympathy. He
was the first reader of the manuscript, and whatever accuracy
may have been arrived at, particularly in the
names of foreign books, foreign persons, and foreign
places, is in great part due to his friendly, careful help.
But of course he has no responsibility whatever for any
of my sins of omission or commission.</p>

<p>By the kind permission of Sir Frederic Burton, I have
been enabled to reproduce as a <a href="#i_front">frontispiece M. Rajon's
etching</a> of the beautiful drawing, executed in 1864, now in
the National Portrait Gallery, South Kensington.</p>

<p>The <a href="#i_182">view of the old house at Rosehill</a> is from a drawing
by Mrs. Bray. It is connected with some of George
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
Eliot's happiest experiences, and with the period of her
most rapid intellectual development.</p>

<p>For permission to use the sketch of the drawing-room
at the Priory I am indebted to the Messrs. Harpers, of
New York.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is in no conventional spirit, but from
my heart, that I bespeak the indulgence of readers for
my share of this work. Of its shortcomings no one can
be so convinced as I am myself.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><i>INTRODUCTORY SKETCH OF CHILDHOOD.</i></h2>


<p>"<i>Nov. 22, 1819.</i>&mdash;Mary Ann Evans was born at
Arbury Farm,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> at five o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>This is an entry, in Mr. Robert Evans's handwriting,
on the page of an old diary that now lies before me,
and records, with characteristic precision, the birth of
his youngest child, afterwards known to the world as
George Eliot. Let us pause for a moment to pay its
due homage to the precision, because it was in all
probability to this most noteworthy quality of her father's
nature that the future author was indebted for
one of the principal elements of her own after-success&mdash;the
enormous faculty for taking pains. The baby
was born on St. Cecilia's day, and Mr. Evans, being a
good churchman, takes her, on the 29th November,
to be baptized in the church at Chilvers Coton&mdash;the
parish in which Arbury Farm lies&mdash;a church destined
to impress itself strongly on the child's imagination,
and to be known by many people in many lands afterwards
as Shepperton Church. The father was a remarkable
man, and many of the leading traits in his
character are to be found in Adam Bede and in Caleb
Garth&mdash;although, of course, neither of these is a portrait.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
He was born in 1773, at Ellaston, in Staffordshire,
son of a George Evans, who carried on the business
of builder and carpenter there: the Evans family
having come originally from Northop, in Flintshire.
Robert was brought up to the business; but about
1799, or a little before, he held a farm of Mr. Francis
Newdigate at Kirk Hallam, in Derbyshire, and became
his agent. On Sir Roger Newdigate's death
the Arbury estate came to Mr. Francis Newdigate for
his life, and Mr. Evans accompanied him into Warwickshire,
in 1806, in the capacity of agent. In 1801
he had married Harriott Poynton, by whom he had
two children&mdash;Robert, born 1802, at Ellaston, and
Frances Lucy, born 1805, at Kirk Hallam. His first
wife died in 1809; and on 8th February, 1813, he
married Christiana Pearson, by whom he had three
children&mdash;Christiana, born 1814; Isaac, born 1816,
and Mary Ann, born 1819. Shortly after the last
child's birth, Robert, the son, became the agent, under
his father, for the Kirk Hallam property, and lived
there with his sister Frances, who afterwards married
a Mr. Houghton. In March, 1820, when the baby
girl was only four months old, the Evans family removed
to Griff, a charming red-brick, ivy-covered
house on the Arbury estate&mdash;"the warm little nest
where her affections were fledged"&mdash;and there George
Eliot spent the first twenty-one years of her life.</p>

<p>Let us remember what the England was upon
which this observant child opened her eyes.</p>

<p>The date of her birth was removed from the beginning
of the French Revolution by just the same period
of time as separates a child, born this year, 1884, from
the beginning of the Crimean War. To a man of
forty-six to-day, the latter event seems but of yesterday.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
It took place at a very impressionable period
of his life, and the remembrance of every detail is perfectly
vivid. Mr. Evans was forty-six when his youngest
child was born. He was a youth of sixteen when
the Revolution began, and that mighty event, with all
its consequences, had left an indelible impression on
him, and the convictions and conclusions it had fostered
in his mind permeated through to his children,
and entered as an indestructible element into the
susceptible soul of his youngest daughter. There are
bits in the paper "Looking Backward," in "Theophrastus
Such," which are true autobiography.</p>

<p>"In my earliest remembrance of my father his hair
was already gray, for I was his youngest child, and it
seemed to me that advanced age was appropriate to
a father, as, indeed, in all respects I considered him a
parent so much to my honor that the mention of my
relationship to him was likely to secure me regard
among those to whom I was otherwise a stranger&mdash;his
stories from his life including so many names of
distant persons that my imagination placed no limit
to his acquaintanceship.... Nor can I be sorry,
though myself given to meditative if not active innovation,
that my father was a Tory who had not exactly
a dislike to innovators and dissenters, but a slight
opinion of them as persons of ill-founded self-confidence....
And I often smile at my consciousness
that certain Conservative prepossessions have mingled
themselves for me with the influences of our Midland
scenery, from the tops of the elms down to the buttercups
and the little wayside vetches. Naturally
enough. That part of my father's prime to which he
oftenest referred had fallen on the days when the
great wave of political enthusiasm and belief in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
speedy regeneration of all things had ebbed, and the
supposed millennial initiative of France was turning
into a Napoleonic empire.... To my father's mind
the noisy teachers of revolutionary doctrine were, to
speak mildly, a variable mixture of the fool and the
scoundrel; the welfare of the nation lay in a strong
government which could maintain order; and I was
accustomed to hear him utter the word 'government'
in a tone that charged it with awe, and made it part
of my effective religion, in contrast with the word
'rebel,' which seemed to carry the stamp of evil in
its syllables, and, lit by the fact that Satan was the
first rebel, made an argument dispensing with more
detailed inquiry."</p>

<p>This early association of ideas must always be borne
in mind, as it is the key to a great deal in the mental
attitude of the future thinker and writer. It is the
foundation of the latent Conservative bias.</p>

<p>The year 1819 is memorable as a culminating period
of bad times and political discontent in England. The
nation was suffering acutely from the reaction after
the excitement of the last Napoleonic war. George IV.
did not come to the throne till January, 1820, so that
George Eliot was born in the reign of George III.
The trial of Queen Caroline was the topic of absorbing
public interest. Waterloo was not yet an affair of
five years old. Byron had four years, and Goethe had
thirteen years, still to live. The last of Miss Austen's
novels had been published only eighteen months, and
the first of the Waverley series only six years before.
Thackeray and Dickens were boys at school, and
George Sand, as a girl of fifteen, was leaving her loved
freedom on the banks of the Indre for the Convent
des Anglaises at Paris. That "Greater Britain" (Canada
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and Australia), which to-day forms so large a reading
public, was then scarcely more than a geographical
expression, with less than half a million of inhabitants,
all told, where at present there are eight millions; and
in the United States, where more copies of George
Eliot's books are now sold than in any other quarter
of the world, the population then numbered less than
ten millions where to-day it is fifty-five millions. Including
Great Britain, these English-speaking races
have increased from thirty millions in 1820 to one hundred
millions in 1884; and with the corresponding increase
in education we can form some conception how
a popular English writer's fame has widened its circle.</p>

<p>There was a remoteness about a detached country-house,
in the England of those days, difficult for us to
conceive now, with our railways, penny-post, and telegraphs;
nor is the Warwickshire country about Griff
an exhilarating surrounding. There are neither hills
nor vales, no rivers, lakes, or sea&mdash;nothing but a monotonous
succession of green fields and hedgerows,
with some fine trees. The only water to be seen is
the "brown canal." The effect of such a landscape
on an ordinary observer is not inspiring, but "effective
magic is transcendent nature;" and with her transcendent
nature George Eliot has transfigured these
scenes, dear to Midland souls, into many an idyllic
picture, known to those who know her books. In her
childhood the great event of the day was the passing
of the coach before the gate of Griff House, which lies
at a bend of the high-road between Coventry and
Nuneaton, and within a couple of miles of the mining
village of Bedworth, "where the land began to be
blackened with coal-pits, the rattle of hand-looms
to be heard in hamlets and villages. Here were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
powerful men walking queerly, with knees bent outward
from squatting in the mine, going home to throw
themselves down in their blackened flannel and sleep
through the daylight, then rise and spend much of
their high wages at the alehouse with their fellows of
the Benefit Club; here the pale, eager faces of hand-loom
weavers, men and women, haggard from sitting
up late at night to finish the week's work, hardly begun
till the Wednesday. Everywhere the cottages and
the small children were dirty, for the languid mothers
gave their strength to the loom; pious Dissenting
women, perhaps, who took life patiently, and thought
that salvation depended chiefly on predestination, and
not at all on cleanliness. The gables of Dissenting
chapels now made a visible sign of religion, and of
a meeting-place to counterbalance the alehouse, even
in the hamlets.... Here was a population not convinced
that old England was as good as possible;
here were multitudinous men and women aware that
their religion was not exactly the religion of their
rulers, who might therefore be better than they were,
and who, if better, might alter many things which
now made the world perhaps more painful than it
need be, and certainly more sinful. Yet there were
the gray steeples too, and the churchyards, with their
grassy mounds and venerable headstones, sleeping
in the sunlight; there were broad fields and homesteads,
and fine old woods covering a rising ground,
or stretching far by the roadside, allowing only peeps
at the park and mansion which they shut in from the
working-day world. In these midland districts the
traveller passed rapidly from one phase of English life
to another; after looking down on a village dingy with
coal-dust, noisy with the shaking of looms, he might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
skirt a parish all of fields, high hedges, and deep-rutted
lanes; after the coach had rattled over the pavement
of a manufacturing town, the scene of riots and trades-union
meetings, it would take him in another ten minutes
into a rural region, where the neighborhood of the
town was only felt in the advantages of a near market
for corn, cheese, and hay, and where men with a considerable
banking account were accustomed to say that
'they never meddled with politics
themselves.'"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>
<p class="center"><b>Griff House&mdash;Front View.</b></p>

<p>We can imagine the excitement of a little four-year-old
girl and her seven-year-old brother waiting, on
bright frosty mornings, to hear the far-off ringing beat
of the horses' feet upon the hard ground, and then to
see the gallant appearance of the four grays, with
coachman and guard in scarlet, outside passengers
muffled up in furs, and baskets of game and other
packages hanging behind the boot, as his majesty's
mail swung cheerily round on its way from Birmingham
to Stamford. Two coaches passed the door daily&mdash;one
from Birmingham at 10 o'clock in the morning,
the other from Stamford at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
These were the chief connecting links between the
household at Griff and the outside world. Otherwise
life went on with that monotonous regularity which
distinguishes the country from the town. And it is to
these circumstances of her early life that a great part
of the quality of George Eliot's writing is due, and
that she holds the place she has attained in English
literature. Her roots were down in the pre-railroad,
pre-telegraphic period&mdash;the days of fine old leisure&mdash;but
the fruit was formed during an era of extraordinary
activity in scientific and mechanical discovery. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
genius was the outcome of these conditions. It would
not have existed in the same form deprived of either
influence. Her father was busy both with his own farm-work
and increasing agency business. He was already
remarked in Warwickshire for his knowledge and judgment
in all matters relating to land, and for his general
trustworthiness and high character, so that he was
constantly selected as arbitrator and valuer. He had a
wonderful eye, especially for valuing woods, and could
calculate with almost absolute precision the quantity
of available timber in a standing tree. In addition to
his merits as a man of business, he had the good fortune
to possess the warm friendship and consistent
support of Colonel Newdigate of Astley Castle, son of
Mr. Francis Newdigate of Arbury, and it was mainly
through the colonel's introduction and influence that
Mr. Evans became agent also to Lord Aylesford, Lord
Lifford, Mr. Bromley Davenport, and several others.</p>

<p>His position cannot be better summed up than in
the words of his daughter, writing to Mr. Bray on 30th
September, 1859, in regard to some one who had written
of her, after the appearance of "Adam Bede," as
a "self-educated farmer's daughter."</p>

<p>"My father did not raise himself from being an artisan
to be a farmer; he raised himself from being an
artisan to be a man whose extensive knowledge in very
varied practical departments made his services valued
through several counties. He had large knowledge of
building, of mines, of plantations, of various branches
of valuation and measurement&mdash;of all that is essential
to the management of large estates. He was held by
those competent to judge as <em>unique</em> among land-agents
for his manifold knowledge and experience, which enabled
him to save the special fees usually paid by landowners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
for special opinions on the different questions
incident to the proprietorship of land. So far as I am
personally concerned I should not write a stroke to
prevent any one, in the zeal of antithetic eloquence,
from calling me a tinker's daughter; but if my father
is to be mentioned at all&mdash;if he is to be identified with
an imaginary character&mdash;my piety towards his memory
calls on me to point out to those who are supposed to
speak with information what he really achieved in life."</p>

<p>Mr. Evans was also, like Adam Bede, noteworthy
for his extraordinary physical strength and determination
of character. There is a story told of him, that
one day when he was travelling on the top of a coach,
down in Kent, a decent woman sitting next him complained
that a great hulking sailor on her other side
was making himself offensive. Mr. Evans changed
places with the woman, and, taking the sailor by the
collar, forced him down under the seat, and held him
there with an iron hand for the remainder of the stage:
and at Griff it is still remembered that the master, happening
to pass one day while a couple of laborers were
waiting for a third to help to move the high, heavy
ladder used for thatching ricks, braced himself up to
a great effort, and carried the ladder alone and unaided
from one rick to the other, to the wide-eyed wonder
and admiration of his men. With all this strength,
however, both of body and of character, he seems to
have combined a certain self-distrust, owing, perhaps,
to his early imperfect education, which resulted in a
general submissiveness in his domestic relations, more
or less portrayed in the character of Mr. Garth.</p>

<p>His second wife was a woman with an unusual
amount of natural force; a shrewd, practical person,
with a considerable dash of the Mrs. Poyser vein in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
her. Hers was an affectionate, warm-hearted nature,
and her children, on whom she cast "the benediction
of her gaze," were thoroughly attached to her. She
came of a race of yeomen, and her social position was,
therefore, rather better than her husband's at the time
of their marriage. Her family are, no doubt, prototypes
of the Dodsons in the "Mill on the Floss."
There were three other sisters married, and all living
in the neighborhood of Griff&mdash;Mrs. Everard, Mrs.
Johnson, and Mrs. Garner&mdash;and probably Mr. Evans
heard a good deal about "the traditions in the Pearson
family." Mrs. Evans was a very active, hard-working
woman, but shortly after her last child's birth she
became ailing in health, and consequently her eldest
girl, Christiana, was sent to school, at a very early age,
to Miss Lathom's, at Attleboro, a village a mile or two
from Griff, while the two younger children spent some
part of their time every day at the cottage of a Mrs.
Moore, who kept a dame's school close to Griff gates.
The little girl very early became possessed with the
idea that she was going to be a personage in the world;
and Mr. Charles Lewes has told me an anecdote which
George Eliot related of herself as characteristic of this
period of her childhood. When she was only four
years old she recollected playing on the piano, of
which she did not know one note, in order to impress
the servant with a proper notion of her acquirements
and generally distinguished position. This was the
time when the love for her brother grew into the
child's affections. She used always to be at his heels,
insisting on doing everything he did. She was not, in
these baby-days, in the least precocious in learning.
In fact, her half-sister, Mrs. Houghton, who was some
fourteen years her senior, told me that the child learned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to read with some difficulty; but Mr. Isaac Evans says
that this was not from any slowness in apprehension,
but because she liked playing so much better. Mere
sharpness, however, was not a characteristic of her
mind. Hers was a large, slow-growing nature; and I
think it is, at any rate, certain that there was nothing
of the infant phenomenon about her. In her moral
development she showed, from the earliest years, the
trait that was most marked in her all through life,
namely, the absolute need of some one person who
should be all in all to her, and to whom she should be
all in all. Very jealous in her affections, and easily
moved to smiles or tears, she was of a nature capable
of the keenest enjoyment and the keenest suffering,
knowing "all the wealth and all the woe" of a pre-eminently
exclusive disposition. She was affectionate,
proud, and sensitive in the highest degree.</p>

<p>The sort of happiness that belongs to this budding-time
of life, from the age of three to five, is apt to impress
itself very strongly on the memory; and it is this
period which is referred to in the Brother and Sister
Sonnet, "But were another childhood's world my share,
I would be born a little sister there." When her brother
was eight years old he was sent to school at Coventry,
and, her mother continuing in very delicate health,
the little Mary Ann, now five years of age, went to
join her sister at Miss Lathom's school, at Attleboro,
where they continued as boarders for three or four
years, coming, occasionally, home to Griff on Saturdays.
During one of our walks at Witley, in 1880, my wife
mentioned to me that what chiefly remained in her
recollection about this very early school-life was the
difficulty of getting near enough the fire in winter to
become thoroughly warmed, owing to the circle of girls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
forming round too narrow a fireplace. This suffering
from cold was the beginning of a low general state of
health; also at this time she began to be subject to
fears at night&mdash;"the susceptibility to terror"&mdash;which
she has described as haunting Gwendolen Harleth in
her childhood. The other girls in the school, who
were all, naturally, very much older, made a great pet
of the child, and used to call her "little mamma," and
she was not unhappy except at nights; but she told
me that this liability to have "all her soul become a
quivering fear," which remained with her afterwards,
had been one of the supremely important influences
dominating at times her future life. Mr. Isaac Evans's
chief recollection of this period is the delight of
the little sister at his home-coming for holidays, and
her anxiety to know all that he had been doing and
learning. The eldest child, who went by the name of
Chrissey, was the chief favorite of the aunts, as she
was always neat and tidy, and used to spend a great
deal of her time with them, while the other two were
inseparable playfellows at home. The boy was his
mother's pet and the girl her father's. They had everything
to make children happy at Griff&mdash;a delightful
old-fashioned garden, a pond and the canal to fish in,
and the farm-offices close to the house, "the long cow-shed,
where generations of the milky mothers have
stood patiently, the broad-shouldered barns, where the
old-fashioned flail once made resonant music," and
where butter-making and cheese-making were carried
on with great vigor by Mrs. Evans.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Griff&mdash;with the Farm Offices.</b></p>

<p>Any one, about this time, who happened to look
through the window on the left-hand side of the door
of Griff House would have seen a pretty picture in
the dining-room on Saturday evenings after tea. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
powerful, middle-aged man with the strongly marked
features sits in his deep, leather-covered arm-chair, at
the right-hand corner of the ruddy fireplace, with the
head of "the little wench" between his knees. The
child turns over the book with pictures that she wishes
her father to explain to her&mdash;or that perhaps she prefers
explaining to him. Her rebellious hair is all over
her eyes, much vexing the pale, energetic mother who
sits on the opposite side of the fire, cumbered with
much service, letting no instant of time escape the inevitable
click of the knitting-needles, accompanied by
epigrammatic speech. The elder girl, prim and tidy,
with her work before her, is by her mother's side; and
the brother, between the two groups, keeps assuring
himself by perpetual search that none of his favorite
means of amusement are escaping from his pockets.
The father is already very proud of the astonishing and
growing intelligence of his little girl. From a very
early age he has been in the habit of taking her with
him in his drives about the neighborhood, "standing
between her father's knees as he drove leisurely," so
that she has drunk in knowledge of the country and
of country folk at all her pores. An old-fashioned
child, already living in a world of her own imagination,
impressible to her finger-tips, and willing to give
her views on any subject.</p>

<p>The first book that George Eliot read, so far as I
have been able to ascertain, was a little volume published
in 1822, entitled "The Linnet's Life," which she
gave to me in the last year of her life, at Witley. It
bears the following inscription, written some time before
she gave it to me:</p>

<p>"This little book is the first present I ever remember
having received from my father. Let any one who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
thinks of me with some tenderness after I am dead
take care of this book for my sake. It made me very
happy when I held it in my little hands, and read it
over and over again; and thought the pictures beautiful,
especially the one where the linnet is feeding her
young."</p>

<p>It must, I think, have been very shortly after she
received this present that an old friend of the family,
who was in the habit of coming as a visitor to Griff
from time to time, used occasionally to bring a book
in his hand for the little girl. I very well remember
her expressing to me deep gratitude for this early ministration
to her childish delights; and Mr. Burne Jones
has been kind enough to tell me of a conversation
with George Eliot about children's books, when she
also referred to this old gentleman's kindness. They
were agreeing in disparagement of some of the books
that the rising generation take their pleasure in, and
she recalled the dearth of child-literature in her own
home, and her passionate delight and total absorption
in Æsop's Fables (given to her by the aforesaid old
gentleman), the possession of which had opened new
worlds to her imagination. Mr. Burne Jones particularly
remembers how she laughed till the tears ran
down her face in recalling her infantine enjoyment of
the humor in the fable of Mercury and the Statue-seller.
Having so few books at this time, she read
them again and again, until she knew them by heart.
One of them was a Joe Miller jest-book, with the stories
from which she used greatly to astonish the family
circle. But the beginning of her serious reading-days
did not come till later. Meantime her talent for observation
gained a glorious new field for employment
in her first journey from home, which took place in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
1826. Her father and mother took her with them on
a little trip into Derbyshire and Staffordshire, where
she saw Mr. Evans's relations, and they came back
through Lichfield, sleeping at the
Swan.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
They were
away only a week, from the 18th to the 24th of May;
but "what time is little" to an imaginative, observant
child of seven on her first journey? About this time
a deeply felt crisis occurred in her life, as her brother
had a pony given to him, to which he became passionately
attached. He developed an absorbing interest
in riding, and cared less and less to play with his sister.
The next important event happened in her eighth
or ninth year, when she was sent to Miss Wallington's
school at Nuneaton with her sister. This was a much
larger school than Miss Lathom's, there being some
thirty girls, boarders. The principal governess was
Miss Lewis, who became then, and remained for many
years after, Mary Ann Evans's most intimate friend
and principal correspondent, and I am indebted to the
letters addressed to her from 1836 to 1842 for most
of the information concerning that period. Books
now became a passion with the child; she read everything
she could lay hands on, greatly troubling the
soul of her mother by the consumption of candles as
well as of eyesight in her bedroom. From a subsequent
letter it will be seen that she was "early supplied
with works of fiction by those who kindly sought
to gratify her appetite for reading."</p>

<p>It must have been about this time that the episode
occurred in relation to "Waverley" which is mentioned
by Miss Simcox in her article in the June, 1881,
number of the <cite>Nineteenth Century Review</cite>. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
quite new to me, and, as it is very interesting, I give
it in Miss Simcox's own words: "Somewhere about
1827 a friendly neighbor lent 'Waverley' to an elder
sister of little Mary Ann Evans. It was returned before
the child had read to the end, and, in her distress
at the loss of the fascinating volume, she began to
write out the story as far as she had read it for herself,
beginning naturally where the story begins with Waverley's
adventures at Tully Veolan, and continuing until
the surprised elders were moved to get her the book
again." Miss Simcox has pointed out the reference
to this in the motto of the 57th chapter of "Middlemarch:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"They numbered scarce eight summers when a name<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Rose on their souls and stirred such motions there<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As thrill the buds and shape their hidden frame<br /></span>
<span class="i4">At penetration of the quickening air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name who told of loyal Evan Dhu,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of quaint Bradwardine, and Vich Ian Vor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making the little world their childhood knew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Large with a land of mountain, lake, and scaur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And larger yet with wonder, love, belief<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Towards Walter Scott, who, living far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent them this wealth of joy and noble grief.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The book and they must part, but, day by day,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In lines that thwart like portly spiders ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They wrote the tale, from Tully Veolan."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Miss Simcox also mentions that "Elia divided her
childish allegiance with Scott, and she remembered
feasting with singular pleasure upon an extract in some
stray almanac from the essay in commemoration of
'Captain Jackson and his slender ration of Single
Gloucester.' This is an extreme example of the general
rule that a wise child's taste in literature is sounder
than adults generally venture to believe."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>We know, too, from the "Mill on the Floss" that the
"History of the Devil," by Daniel Defoe, was a favorite.
The book is still religiously preserved at Griff,
with its pictures just as Maggie looked at them. "The
Pilgrim's Progress," also, and "Rasselas" had a large
share of her affections.</p>

<p>At Miss Wallington's the growing girl soon distinguished
herself by an easy mastery of the usual school-learning
of her years, and there, too, the religious side
of her nature was developed to a remarkable degree.
Miss Lewis was an ardent Evangelical Churchwoman,
and exerted a strong influence on her young pupil,
whom she found very sympathetically inclined. But
Mary Ann Evans did not associate freely with her
schoolfellows, and her friendship with Miss Lewis was
the only intimacy she indulged in.</p>

<p>On coming home for their holidays the sister and
brother began, about this time, the habit of acting
charades together before the Griff household and the
aunts, who were greatly impressed with the cleverness
of the performance; and the girl was now recognized
in the family circle as no ordinary child.</p>

<p>Another epoch presently succeeded, on her removal
to Miss Franklin's school at Coventry, in her thirteenth
year. She was probably then very much what she has
described her own Maggie at the age of thirteen:</p>

<p>"A creature full of eager, passionate longings for
all that was beautiful and glad; thirsty for all knowledge;
with an ear straining after dreamy music that
died away and would not come near to her; with a
blind, unconscious yearning for something that would
link together the wonderful impressions of this mysterious
life, and give her soul a sense of home in it. No
wonder, when there is this contrast between the outward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and the inward, that painful collisions come of
it."</p>

<p>In <cite>Our Times</cite> of June, 1881, there is a paper by
a lady whose mother was at school with Mary Ann
Evans, which gives some interesting particulars of the
Miss Franklins.</p>

<p>"They were daughters of a Baptist minister who
had preached for many years in Coventry, and who
inhabited, during his pastorate, a house in the chapel-yard
almost exactly resembling that of Rufus Lyon
in 'Felix Holt.' For this venerable gentleman Miss
Evans, as a schoolgirl, had a great admiration, and I,
who can remember him well, can trace in Rufus Lyon
himself many slight resemblances, such as the 'little
legs,' and the habit of walking up and down when
composing. Miss Rebecca Franklin was a lady of
considerable intellectual power, and remarkable for
her elegance in writing and conversation, as well as
for her beautiful calligraphy. In her classes for English
Composition Mary Ann Evans was, from her first
entering the school, far in advance of the rest; and
while the themes of the other children were read, criticised,
and corrected in class, hers were reserved for
the private perusal and enjoyment of the teacher, who
rarely found anything to correct. Her enthusiasm for
music was already very strongly marked, and her music-master,
a much-tried man, suffering from the irritability
incident to his profession, reckoned on his hour with
her as a refreshment to his wearied nerves, and soon
had to confess that he had no more to teach her. In
connection with this proficiency in music, my mother
recalls her sensitiveness at that time as being painfully
extreme. When there were visitors, Miss Evans,
as the best performer in the school, was sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
summoned to the parlor to play for their amusement,
and though suffering agonies from shyness and reluctance,
she obeyed with all readiness, but, on being released,
my mother has often known her to rush to her
room and throw herself on the floor in an agony of
tears. Her schoolfellows loved her as much as they
could venture to love one whom they felt to be so immeasurably
superior to themselves, and she had playful
nicknames for most of them. My mother, who was
delicate, and to whom she was very kind, was dubbed
by her 'Miss Equanimity.' A source of great interest
to the girls, and of envy to those who lived farther
from home, was the weekly cart which brought Miss
Evans new-laid eggs and other delightful produce of
her father's farm."</p>

<p>In talking about these early days, my wife impressed
on my mind the debt she felt that she owed to the Miss
Franklins for their excellent instruction, and she had
also the very highest respect for their moral qualities.
With her chameleon-like nature she soon adopted their
religious views with intense eagerness and conviction,
although she never formally joined the Baptists or any
other communion than the Church of England. She
at once, however, took a foremost place in the school,
and became a leader of prayer-meetings among the
girls. In addition to a sound English education the
Miss Franklins managed to procure for their pupils
excellent masters for French, German, and music; so
that, looking to the lights of those times, the means of
obtaining knowledge were very much above the average
for girls. Her teachers, on their side, were very
proud of their exceptionally gifted scholar; and years
afterwards, when Miss Evans came with her father to
live in Coventry, they introduced her to one of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
friends, not only as a marvel of mental power, but also
as a person "sure to get something up very soon in
the way of clothing-club or other charitable undertaking."</p>

<p>This year, 1832, was not only memorable for the
change to a new and superior school, but it was also
much more memorable to George Eliot for the riot
which she saw at Nuneaton, on the occasion of the
election for North Warwickshire, after the passing of
the great Reform Bill, and which subsequently furnished
her with the incidents for the riot in "Felix Holt." It
was an event to lay hold on the imagination of an impressionable
girl of thirteen, and it is thus described
in the local newspaper of 29th December, 1832:</p>

<p>"On Friday, the 21st December, at Nuneaton, from
the commencement of the poll till nearly half-past two,
the Hemingites<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
occupied the poll; the numerous
plumpers for Sir Eardley Wilmot and the adherents of
Mr. Dugdale being constantly interrupted in their endeavors
to go to the hustings to give an honest and
conscientious vote. The magistrates were consequently
applied to, and from the representations they received
from all parties, they were at length induced to
call in aid a military force. A detachment of the Scots
Greys accordingly arrived; but it appearing that that
gallant body was not sufficiently strong to put down
the turbulent spirit of the mob, a reinforcement was
considered by the constituted authorities as absolutely
necessary. The tumult increasing, as the detachment
of the Scots Greys were called in, the Riot Act was read
from the windows of the Newdigate Arms; and we regret
to add that both W. P. Inge, Esq., and Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Newdigate, in the discharge of their magisterial duties,
received personal injuries.</p>

<p>"On Saturday the mob presented an appalling appearance,
and but for the forbearance of the soldiery
numerous lives would have fallen a sacrifice. Several
of the officers of the Scots Greys were materially hurt
in their attempt to quell the riotous proceedings of the
mob. During the day the sub-sheriffs at the different
booths received several letters from the friends of Mr.
Dugdale, stating that they were outside of the town,
and anxious to vote for that gentleman, but were deterred
from entering it from fear of personal violence.
Two or three unlucky individuals, drawn from the files
of the military on their approach to the poll, were
cruelly beaten, and stripped literally naked. We regret
to add that one life has been sacrificed during the
contest, and that several misguided individuals have
been seriously injured."</p>

<p>The term ending Christmas, 1835, was the last spent
at Miss Franklin's. In the first letter of George Eliot's
that I have been able to discover, dated 6th January,
1836, and addressed to Miss Lewis, who was at that
time governess in the family of the Rev. L. Harper,
Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, she speaks of her
mother having suffered a great increase of pain, and
adds&mdash;</p>

<p>"We dare not hope that there will be a permanent
improvement. Our anxieties on my mother's account,
though so great, have been since Thursday almost lost
sight of in the more sudden, and consequently more
severe, trial which we have been called on to endure
in the alarming illness of my dear father. For four
days we had no cessation of our anxiety; but I am
thankful to say that he is now considered out of danger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
though very much reduced by frequent bleeding
and very powerful medicines."</p>

<p>In the summer of this year&mdash;1836&mdash;the mother died,
after a long, painful illness, in which she was nursed
with great devotion by her daughters. It was their
first acquaintance with death; and to a highly wrought,
sensitive girl of sixteen such a loss seems an unendurable
calamity. "To the old, sorrow is sorrow; to the
young, it is despair." Many references will be found
in the subsequent correspondence to what she suffered
at this time, all summed up in the old popular phrase,
"We can have but one mother." In the following
spring Christiana was married to Mr. Edward Clarke,
a surgeon practising at Meriden, in Warwickshire. One
of Mr. Isaac Evans's most vivid recollections is that
on the day of the marriage, after the bride's departure,
he and his younger sister had "a good cry" together
over the break-up of the old home-life, which of course
could never be the same with the mother and the elder
sister wanting.</p>

<p>Twenty-three years later we shall find George Eliot
writing, on the death of this sister, that she "had a
very special feeling for her&mdash;stronger than any third
person would think likely." The relation between the
sisters was somewhat like that described as existing
between Dorothea and Celia in "Middlemarch"&mdash;no
intellectual affinity, but a strong family affection. In
fact, my wife told me, that although Celia was not in
any sense a portrait of her sister, she "had Chrissey
continually in mind" in delineating Celia's character.
But we must be careful not to found too much on such
<em>suggestions</em> of character in George Eliot's books; and
this must particularly be borne in mind in the "Mill
on the Floss." No doubt the early part of Maggie's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
portraiture is the best autobiographical representation
we can have of George Eliot's own feelings in her
childhood, and many of the incidents in the book are
based on real experiences of family life, but so mixed
with fictitious elements and situations that it would be
absolutely misleading to trust to it as a true history.
For instance, all that happened in real life between the
brother and sister was, I believe, that as they grew up
their characters, pursuits, and tastes diverged more and
more widely. He took to his father's business, at which
he worked steadily, and which absorbed most of his
time and attention. He was also devoted to hunting,
liked the ordinary pleasures of a young man in his
circumstances, and was quite satisfied with the circle
of acquaintance in which he moved. After leaving
school at Coventry he went to a private tutor's at Birmingham,
where he imbibed strong High-Church views.
His sister had come back from the Miss Franklins'
with ultra-Evangelical tendencies, and their differences
of opinion used to lead to a good deal of animated
argument. Miss Evans, as she now was, could not
rest satisfied with a mere profession of faith without
trying to shape her own life&mdash;and, it may be added, the
lives around her&mdash;in accordance with her convictions.
The pursuit of pleasure was a snare; dress was vanity;
society was a danger.</p>

<p>"From what you know of her, you will not be surprised
that she threw some exaggeration and wilfulness,
some pride and impetuosity, even into her self-renunciation:
her own life was still a drama for her,
in which she demanded of herself that her part should
be played with intensity. And so it came to pass that
she often lost the spirit of humility by being excessive
in the outward act; she often strove after too high a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
flight, and came down with her poor little half-fledged
wings dabbled in the mud.... That is the path we all
like when we set out on our abandonment of egoism&mdash;the
path of martyrdom and endurance, where the palm-branches
grow, rather than the steep highway of tolerance,
just allowance, and self-blame, where there are
no leafy honors to be gathered and
worn."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>After Christiana's marriage the entire charge of the
Griff establishment devolved on Mary Ann, who became
a most exemplary housewife, learned thoroughly
everything that had to be done, and, with her innate
desire for perfection, was never satisfied unless her department
was administered in the very best manner
that circumstances permitted. She spent a great deal
of time in visiting the poor, organizing clothing-clubs,
and other works of active charity. But over and above
this, as will be seen from the following letters, she was
always prosecuting an active intellectual life of her own.
Mr. Brezzi, a well-known master of modern languages
at Coventry, used to come over to Griff regularly to
give her lessons in Italian and German. Mr. M'Ewen,
also from Coventry, continued her lessons in music,
and she got through a large amount of miscellaneous
reading by herself. In the evening she was always in
the habit of playing to her father, who was very fond
of music. But it requires no great effort of imagination
to conceive that this life, though full of interests
of its own, and the source from whence the future
novelist drew the most powerful and the most touching
of her creations, was, as a matter of fact, very monotonous,
very difficult, very discouraging. It could scarcely
be otherwise to a young girl with a full, passionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
nature and hungry intellect, shut up in a farmhouse in
the remote country. For there was no sympathetic human
soul near with whom to exchange ideas on the intellectual
and spiritual problems that were beginning
to agitate her mind. "You may try, but you can never
imagine what it is to have a man's force of genius in
you, and yet to suffer the slavery of being a
girl."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
This is a point of view that must be distinctly recognized
by any one attempting to follow the development
of George Eliot's character, and it will always be
corrected by the other point of view which she has
made so prominent in all her own writing&mdash;the soothing,
strengthening, sacred influences of the home life, the
home loves, the home duties. Circumstances in later
life separated her from her kindred, but among her last
letters it will be seen that she wrote to her brother in
May, 1880, that "our long silence has never broken
the affection for you that began when we were little
ones"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
&mdash;and she expresses her satisfaction in the
growing prosperity of himself and all his family. It
was a real gratification to her to hear from some Coventry
friends that her nephew, the Rev. Frederic Evans,
the present rector of Bedworth, was well spoken of as
a preacher in the old familiar places, and in our last
summer at Witley we often spoke of a visit to Warwickshire,
that she might renew the sweet memories of
her child-days. No doubt, the very monotony of her
life at Griff, and the narrow field it presented for observation
of society, added immeasurably to the intensity
of a naturally keen mental vision, concentrating into
a focus what might perhaps have become dissipated in
more liberal surroundings. And though the field of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
observation was narrow in one sense, it included very
various grades of society. Such fine places as Arbury,
and Packington, the seat of Lord Aylesford, where she
was being constantly driven by her father, affected the
imagination and accentuated the social differences&mdash;differences
which had a profound significance for such
a sensitive and such an intellectually commanding
character, and which left their mark on it.</p>

<p>"No one who has not a strong natural prompting
and susceptibility towards such things [the signs and
luxuries of ladyhood] and has, at the same time, suffered
from the presence of opposite conditions, can
understand how powerfully those minor accidents of
rank which please the fastidious sense can preoccupy
the imagination."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The tone of her mind will be seen from the letters
written during the following years, and I remember
once, after we were married, when I was urging her to
write her autobiography, she said, half sighing, half
smiling, "The only thing I should care much to dwell
on would be the absolute despair I suffered from of
ever being able to achieve anything. No one could
ever have felt greater despair, and a knowledge of this
might be a help to some other struggler"&mdash;adding, with
a smile, "but, on the other hand, it might only lead to
an increase of bad writing."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>In the foregoing introductory sketch I have endeavored
to present the influences to which George Eliot
was subjected in her youth, and the environment in
which she grew up; I am now able to begin the fulfilment
of the promise on the titlepage, that the life will
be related in her own letters; or, rather, in extracts
from her own letters, for no single letter is printed entire
from the beginning to the end. I have not succeeded
in obtaining any between 6th January, 1836,
and 18th August, 1838; but from the latter date the
correspondence becomes regular, and I have arranged
it as a continuous narrative, with the names of the
persons to whom the letters are addressed in the margin.
The slight thread of narrative or explanation
which I have written to elucidate the letters, where
necessary, will hereafter occupy an inside margin, so
that the reader will see at a glance what is narrative
and what is correspondence, and will be troubled as
little as possible with marks of quotation or changes
of type.</p>

<blockquote><p>The following opening letter of the series to Miss
Lewis describes a first visit to London with her
brother:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to Miss
Lewis,
18th Aug.
1838.</div>

<p>Let me tell you, though, that I was not at all delighted
with the stir of the great Babel, and the less so,
probably, owing to the circumstances attending my
visit thither. Isaac and I went alone (that seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
rather Irish), and stayed only a week, every day of
which we worked hard at seeing sights. I think
Greenwich Hospital interested me more than anything
else.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Isaac Evans himself tells me that what he
remembers chiefly impressed her was the first hearing
the great bell of St. Paul's. It affected her
deeply. At that time she was so much under the
influence of religious and ascetic ideas that she
would not go to any of the theatres with her brother,
but spent all her evenings alone, reading. A
characteristic reminiscence is that the chief thing
she wanted to buy was Josephus's "History of the
Jews;" and at the same bookshop her brother got
her this he bought for himself a pair of hunting
sketches. In the same letter, alluding to the marriage
of one of her friends, she says:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to Miss
Lewis,

1838.</div>

<p>For my part, when I hear of the marrying and giving
in marriage that is constantly being transacted, I can
only sigh for those who are multiplying earthly ties
which, though powerful enough to detach their hearts
and thoughts from heaven, are so brittle as to be liable
to be snapped asunder at every breeze. You will
think that I need nothing but a tub for my habitation
to make me a perfect female Diogenes; and I plead
guilty to occasional misanthropical thoughts, but not
to the indulgence of them. Still, I must believe that
those are happiest who are not fermenting themselves
by engaging in projects for earthly bliss, who are considering
this life merely a pilgrimage, a scene calling
for diligence and watchfulness, not for repose and
amusement. I do not deny that there may be many
who can partake with a high degree of zest of all the
lawful enjoyments the world can offer, and yet live in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
near communion with their God&mdash;who can warmly love
the creature, and yet be careful that the Creator maintains
his supremacy in their hearts; but I confess that,
in my short experience and narrow sphere of action, I
have never been able to attain to this. I find, as Dr.
Johnson said respecting his wine, total abstinence
much easier than moderation. I do not wonder you
are pleased with Pascal;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
his thoughts may be returned
to the palate again and again with increasing
rather than diminished relish. I have highly enjoyed
Hannah More's letters; the contemplation of so blessed
a character as hers is very salutary. "That ye be
not slothful, but followers of them who, through faith
and patience, inherit the promises," is a valuable admonition.
I was once told that there was nothing out
of myself to prevent my becoming as eminently holy
as St. Paul; and though I think that is too sweeping
an assertion, yet it is very certain we are generally too
low in our aims, more anxious for safety than sanctity,
for place than purity, forgetting that each involves the
other, and that, as Doddridge tells us, to rest satisfied
with any attainments in religion is a fearful proof
that we are ignorant of the very first principles of it.
O that we could live only for eternity! that we could realize
its nearness! I know you do not love quotations,
so I will not give you one; but if you do not distinctly
remember it, do turn to the passage in Young's "Infidel
Reclaimed," beginning, "O vain, vain, vain all else
eternity," and do love the lines for my sake.</p>

<p>I really feel for you, sacrificing, as you are, your own
tastes and comforts for the pleasure of others, and that
in a manner the most trying to rebellious flesh and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
blood; for I verily believe that in most cases it requires
more of a martyr's spirit to endure, with patience
and cheerfulness, daily crossings and interruptions of
our petty desires and pursuits, and to rejoice in them
if they can be made to conduce to God's glory and our
own sanctification, than even to lay down our lives for
the truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to Miss
Lewis,
6th Nov.
1838.</div>

<p>I can hardly repress a sort of indignation towards
second causes. That your time and energies should
be expended in ministering to the petty interests of
those far beneath you in all that is really elevating is
about as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bienséant</i> as that I should set fire to a goodly
volume to light a match by! I have had a very unsettled
life lately&mdash;Michaelmas, with its onerous duties
and anxieties, much company (for us) and little reading,
so that I am ill prepared for corresponding with
profit or pleasure. I am generally in the same predicament
with books as a glutton with his feast, hurrying
through one course that I may be in time for the
next, and so not relishing or digesting either; not a
very elegant illustration, but the best my organs of
ideality and comparison will furnish just now.</p>

<p>I have just begun the "Life of Wilberforce," and I am
expecting a rich treat from it. There is a similarity,
if I may compare myself with such a man, between
his temptations, or rather <i>besetments</i>, and my own, that
makes his experience very interesting to me. O that
I might be made as useful in my lowly and obscure
station as he was in the exalted one assigned to him!
I feel myself to be a mere cumberer of the ground.
May the Lord give me such an insight into what is
truly good that I may not rest contented with making
Christianity a mere addendum to my pursuits, or with
tacking it as a fringe to my garments! May I seek to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
be sanctified wholly! My nineteenth birthday will
soon be here (the 22d)&mdash;an awakening signal. My
mind has been much clogged lately by languor of
body, to which I am prone to give way, and for the
removal of which I shall feel thankful.</p>

<p>We have had an oratorio at Coventry lately, Braham,
Phillips, Mrs. Knyvett, and Mrs. Shaw&mdash;the last,
I think, I shall attend. I am not fitted to decide on
the question of the propriety or lawfulness of such exhibitions
of talent and so forth, because I have no soul
for music. "Happy is he that condemneth not himself
in that thing which he alloweth." I am a tasteless
person, but it would not cost me any regrets if the
only music heard in our land were that of strict worship,
nor can I think a pleasure that involves the devotion
of all the time and powers of an immortal being
to the acquirement of an expertness in so useless (at
least in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred) an accomplishment,
can be quite pure or elevating in its tendency.</p>

<blockquote><p>The above remarks on oratorio are the more surprising
because, two years later, when Miss Evans
went to the Birmingham festival, in September,
1840, previous to her brother's marriage, she was
affected to an extraordinary degree, so much so
that Mrs. Isaac Evans&mdash;then Miss Rawlins&mdash;told
me that the attention of people sitting near was
attracted by her hysterical sobbing. And in all
her later life music was one of the chiefest delights
to her, and especially oratorio.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Not that her enjoyment of music was of the kind
that indicates a great specific talent; it was rather
that her sensibility to the supreme excitement of music
was only one form of that passionate sensibility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which belonged to her whole nature, and made her
faults and virtues all merge in each other&mdash;made her
affections sometimes an impatient demand, but also
prevented her vanity from taking the form of mere
feminine coquetry and device, and gave it the poetry
of ambition."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The next two letters, dated from Griff&mdash;February
6th and March 5th, 1839&mdash;are addressed to
Mrs. Samuel Evans, a Methodist preacher, the wife
of a younger brother of Mr. Robert Evans. They
are the more interesting from the fact, which will
appear later, that an anecdote related by this aunt
during her visit to Griff in 1839 was the germ of
"Adam Bede." To what extent this Elizabeth
Evans resembled the ideal character of Dinah
Morris will also be seen in its place in the history
of "Adam Bede."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I am so unwilling to believe that you can forget a
promise, or to entertain fears respecting your health,
that I persuade myself I must have mistaken the
terms of the agreement between us, and that I ought
to have sent you a letter before I considered myself
entitled to one from Wirksworth. However this may
be, I feel so anxious to hear of your well-being in
every way, that I can no longer rest satisfied without
using my only means of obtaining tidings of you.
My dear father is not at home to-night, or I should
probably have a message of remembrance to give you
from him, in addition to the good news that he is as
well as he has been for the last two years, and even,
I think, better, except that he feels more fatigue after
exertion of mind or body than formerly. If you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
able to fill a sheet, I am sure both uncle and you
would in doing so be complying with the precept,
"Lift up the hands that hang down, and strengthen
the feeble knees." I need not tell you that this is a
dry and thirsty land, and I shall be as grateful to you
for a draught from your fresh spring as the traveller
in the Eastern desert is to the unknown hand that
digs a well for him. "Unstable as water, thou shalt
not excel," seems to be my character, instead of that
regular progress from strength to strength that marks,
even in this world of mistakes, the people that shall,
in the heavenly Zion, stand before God. I shall not
only suffer, but be delighted to receive, the word of
exhortation, and I beg you not to withhold it. If I
did not know how little you need human help, I
should regret that my ignorance and want of deep
feeling in spiritual things prevent me from suggesting
profitable or refreshing thoughts; but I dare say I
took care to tell you that my desire for correspondence
with you was quite one of self-interest.</p>

<p>I am thankful to tell you that my dear friends here
are all well. I have a faint hope that the pleasure
and profit I have felt in your society may be repeated
in the summer: there is no place I would rather visit
than Wirksworth, or the inhabitants of which have a
stronger hold on my affections.</p>

<p>My dear father is just now so plunged in business,
and that of a fatiguing kind, that I should put your
confidence in my love and gratitude to an unreasonably
severe trial if I waited until he had leisure to
unite with me in filling a sheet. You were very kind
to remember my wish to see "Mrs. Fletcher's Life:" I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
only desire such a spiritual digestion as has enabled
<em>you</em> to derive so much benefit from its perusal. I
am truly glad to hear that you are less embarrassed
with respect to your congregation, etc., than you were
when we saw you. I must protest against your making
apologies for speaking of yourself, for nothing that
relates to you can be uninteresting to me.</p>

<p>The unprofitableness you lament in yourself, during
your visit to us, had its true cause, not in your lukewarmness,
but in the little improvement I sought to
derive from your society, and in my lack of humility
and Christian simplicity, that makes me willing to obtain
credit for greater knowledge and deeper feeling
than I really possess. Instead of putting my light
under a bushel, I am in danger of ostentatiously displaying
a false one. You have much too high an
opinion, my dear aunt, of my spiritual condition, and
of my personal and circumstantial advantages. My
soul seems for weeks together completely benumbed,
and when I am aroused from this torpid state, the
intervals of activity are comparatively short. I am
ever finding excuses for this in the deprivation of
outward excitement and the small scope I have for
the application of my principles, instead of feeling
self-abasement under the consciousness that I abuse
precious hours of retirement, which would be eagerly
employed in spiritual exercises by many a devoted
servant of God who is struggling with worldly cares
and occupations. I feel that my besetting sin is the
one of all others most destroying, as it is the fruitful
parent of them all&mdash;ambition, a desire insatiable for
the esteem of my fellow-creatures. This seems the
centre whence all my actions proceed. But you will
perhaps remember, my dear aunt, that I do not attach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
much value to a disclosure of religious feelings, owing
probably to the dominant corruption I have just been
speaking of, which "turns the milk of my good purpose
all to curd."</p>

<blockquote><p>On 16th March, 1839, in a letter to Miss Lewis,
there is a reference to good spirits, which is of the
rarest occurrence all through the correspondence:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to Miss
Lewis, 16th
Mch. 1839.</div>

<p>I am this morning hardly myself, owing to the insuppressible
rising of my animal spirits on a deliverance
from sick headache;</p>

<blockquote><p>and then the letter continues as to the expediency
of reading works of fiction, in answer to a question
Miss Lewis had asked:</p></blockquote>

<p>I put out of the question all persons of perceptions so
quick, memories so eclectic and retentive, and minds
so comprehensive that nothing less than omnivorous
reading, as Southey calls it, can satisfy their intellectual
man; for (if I may parody the words of Scripture
without profaneness) they will gather to themselves
all facts, and heap unto themselves all ideas. For
such persons we cannot legislate. Again, I would put
out of the question standard works, whose contents
are matter of constant reference, and the names of
whose heroes and heroines briefly, and therefore conveniently,
describe characters and ideas&mdash;such are
"Don Quixote," Butler's "Hudibras," "Robinson
Crusoe," "Gil Blas," Byron's Poetical Romances,
Southey's ditto, etc. Such, too, are Walter Scott's
novels and poems. Such allusions as "He is a perfect
Dominie Sampson," "He is as industrious in
finding out antiquities, and about as successful, as
Jonathan Oldbuck," are likely to become so common
in books and conversation that, <em>always providing</em> our
leisure is not circumscribed by duty within narrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
bounds, we should, I think, qualify ourselves to understand
them. Shakespeare has a higher claim than this
on our attention; but we have need of as nice a power
of distillation as the bee, to suck nothing but honey
from his pages. However, as in life we must be exposed
to malign influences from intercourse with others,
if we would reap the advantages designed for us
by making us social beings, so in books. Having
cleared our way of what would otherwise have encumbered
us, I would ask why is one engaged in the
instruction of youth to read, as a purely conscientious
and self-denying performance of duty, works whose
value to others is allowed to be doubtful? I can only
imagine two shadows of reasons. Either that she
may be able experimentally to decide on their desirableness
for her pupils, or else that there is a certain
power exerted by them on the mind that would render
her a more efficient "tutress" by their perusal. I
would not depreciate the disinterestedness of those
who will make trial of the effect on themselves of a
cup suspected poisonous, that they may deter another
from risking life; but it appears to me a work of supererogation,
since there are enough witnesses to its
baneful effect on themselves already to put an end to
all strife in the matter. The Scriptural declaration,
"As face answereth to face in a glass, so the heart of
man to man," will exonerate me from the charge of
uncharitableness, or too high an estimation of myself,
if I venture to believe that the same causes which
exist in my own breast to render novels and romances
pernicious have their counterpart in that of every
fellow-creature. I am, I confess, not an impartial
member of a jury in this case; for I owe the culprits
a grudge for injuries inflicted on myself. When I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was quite a little child I could not be satisfied with
the things around me; I was constantly living in a
world of my own creation, and was quite contented to
have no companions, that I might be left to my own
musings, and imagine scenes in which I was chief
actress. Conceive what a character novels would
give to these Utopias. I was early supplied with
them by those who kindly sought to gratify my appetite
for reading, and of course I made use of the materials
they supplied for building my castles in the
air. But it may be said&mdash;"No one ever dreamed of
recommending children to read them: all this does
not apply to persons come to years of discretion, whose
judgments are in some degree matured." I answer
that men and women are but children of a larger
growth: they are still imitative beings. We cannot
(at least those who ever read to any purpose at all)&mdash;we
cannot, I say, help being modified by the ideas
that pass through our minds. We hardly wish to lay
claim to such elasticity as retains no impress. We
are active beings too. We are each one of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis
personæ</i> in some play on the stage of life;
hence our actions have their share in the effects of
our reading. As to the discipline our minds receive
from the perusal of fictions, I can conceive none that
is beneficial but may be attained by that of history.
It is the merit of fictions to come within the orbit of
probability: if unnatural they would no longer please.
If it be said the mind must have relaxation, "Truth is
strange&mdash;stranger than fiction." When a person has
exhausted the wonders of truth there is no other resort
than fiction: till then, I cannot imagine how the
adventures of some phantom conjured up by fancy
can be more entertaining than the transactions of real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
specimens of human nature, from which we may safely
draw inferences. I dare say Mr. James's "Huguenot"
would be recommended as giving an idea of the times
of which he writes; but as well may one be recommended
to look at landscapes for an idea of English
scenery. The real secret of the relaxation talked of
is one that would not generally be avowed; but an
appetite that wants seasoning of a certain kind cannot
be indicative of health. Religious novels are more
hateful to me than merely worldly ones: they are a
sort of centaur or mermaid, and, like other monsters
that we do not know how to class, should be destroyed
for the public good as soon as born. The weapons
of the Christian warfare were never sharpened at the
forge of romance. Domestic fictions, as they come
more within the range of imitation, seem more dangerous.
For my part, I am ready to sit down and
weep at the impossibility of my understanding or
barely knowing a fraction of the sum of objects that
present themselves for our contemplation in books
and in life. Have I, then, any time to spend on
things that never existed?</p>

<p>You allude to the religious, or rather irreligious,
contentions that form so prominent a feature in the
aspect of public affairs&mdash;a subject, you will perhaps be
surprised to hear me say, full of interest to me, and on
which I am unable to shape an opinion for the satisfaction
of my mind. I think no one feels more difficulty
in coming to a decision on controverted matters
than myself. I do not mean that I have not preferences;
but, however congruous a theory may be with
my notions, I cannot find that comfortable repose that
others appear to possess after having made their election
of a class of sentiments. The other day Montaigne's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
motto came to my mind (it is mentioned by
Pascal) as an appropriate one for me&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que sais-je?</span>"&mdash;beneath
a pair of balances, though, by-the-bye, it
is an ambiguous one, and may be taken in a sense
that I desire to reprobate, as well as in a Scriptural
one, to which I do not refer. I use it in a limited
sense as a representation of my oscillating judgment.
On no subject do I veer to all points of the compass
more frequently than on the nature of the visible
Church. I am powerfully attracted in a certain direction,
but, when I am about to settle there, counter-assertions
shake me from my position. I cannot enter
into details, but when we are together I will tell
you all my difficulties&mdash;that is, if you will be kind
enough to listen. I have been reading the new prize
essay on "Schism," by Professor Hoppus, and Milner's
"Church History," since I last wrote to you: the former
ably expresses the tenets of those who deny that
any form of Church government is so clearly dictated
in Scripture as to possess a divine right, and, consequently,
to be binding on Christians; the latter, you
know, exhibits the views of a moderate Evangelical
Episcopalian on the inferences to be drawn from
ecclesiastical remains. He equally repudiates the
loud assertion of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus divinum</i>, to the exclusion of
all separatists from the visible Church, though he
calmly maintains the superiority of the evidence in
favor of Episcopacy, of a moderate kind both in power
and extent of diocese, as well as the benefit of a
national establishment. I have been skimming the
"Portrait of an English Churchman," by the Rev.
W. Gresley: this contains an outline of the system of
those who exclaim of the Anglican Church as the Jews
did of their sacred building (that they do it in as reprehensible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a spirit I will not be the judge), "the temple
of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of
the Lord" is exclusively theirs; while the authors of
the Oxford Tracts go a step further, and evince by
their compliments to Rome, as a dear though erring
sister, and their attempts to give a Romish color to
our ordinance, with a very confused and unscriptural
statement of the great doctrine of justification, a disposition
rather to fraternize with the members of a
Church carrying on her brow the prophetical epithets
applied by St. John to the scarlet beast, the mystery
of iniquity, than with pious Nonconformists. It is
true they disclaim all this, and that their opinions are
seconded by the extensive learning, the laborious zeal,
and the deep devotion of those who propagate them;
but a reference to facts will convince us that such has
generally been the character of heretical teachers.
Satan is too crafty to commit his cause into the hands
of those who have nothing to recommend them to
approbation. According to their dogmas, the Scotch
Church and the foreign Protestant Churches, as well
as the non-Episcopalians of our own land, are wanting
in the essentials of existence as part of the Church.</p>

<p>I have lately led so unsettled a life, and have been
so desultory in my employments, that my mind, never
of the most highly organized genus, is more than usually
chaotic, or, rather, it is like a stratum of conglomerated
fragments, that shows here a jaw and rib of
some ponderous quadruped, there a delicate alto-relievo
of some fern-like plant, tiny shells and mysterious
nondescripts incrusted and united with some
unvaried and uninteresting but useful stone. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
mind presents just such an assemblage of disjointed
specimens of history, ancient and modern; scraps of
poetry picked up from Shakespeare, Cowper, Wordsworth,
and Milton; newspaper topics; morsels of Addison
and Bacon, Latin verbs, geometry, entomology,
and chemistry; reviews and metaphysics&mdash;all arrested
and petrified and smothered by the fast-thickening
every-day accession of actual events, relative anxieties,
and household cares and vexations. How deplorably
and unaccountably evanescent are our frames of mind,
as various as the forms and hues of the summer
clouds! A single word is sometimes enough to give
an entirely new mould to our thoughts&mdash;at least, I find
myself so constituted; and therefore to me it is pre-eminently
important to be anchored within the veil, so
that outward things may be unable to send me adrift.
Write to me as soon as you can. Remember Michaelmas

<p>I have emerged from the slough of domestic troubles,

and am beginning to take a deep breath in my own
element, though with a mortifying consciousness that
my faculties have become superlatively obtuse during
my banishment from it. I have been so self-indulgent
as to possess myself of Wordsworth at full length, and
I thoroughly like much of the contents of the first three
volumes, which I fancy are only the low vestibule of the
three remaining ones. I never before met with so
many of my own feelings expressed just as I could
like them. The distress of the lower classes in our
neighborhood is daily increasing, from the scarcity of
employment for weavers, and I seem sadly to have

ask Mr. Craig what he considers the best authority for
the date of the apostolical writings? I should like to
carry the chart down to the Reformation, if my time

months, miserably noisy and disorderly with the musical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
operations of masons, carpenters, and painters.
You know how abhorrent all this is to my tastes and
feelings, taking all the spice out of my favorite little
epithet, "this working-day world:" I can no longer
use it figuratively. How impressive must the gradual
rise of Solomon's Temple have been! each prepared
mass of virgin marble laid in reverential silence. I
fancy Heber has compared it to the growth of a palm.
Your nice miniature chart, which I shall carefully
treasure up, has quite satisfied me that Dr. Pearson, at
least, has not realized my conceptions, though it has
left me still dubious as to my own power of doing so.
I will just (if you can bear to hear more of the matter)
give you an idea of the plan, which may have partly
faded from your memory. The series of perpendicular
columns will successively contain the Roman emperors,
with their dates, the political and religious state of
the Jews, the bishops, remarkable men, and events in
the several churches, a column being devoted to each
of the chief ones, the aspect of heathenism and Judaism
towards Christianity, the chronology of the apostolical
and patristical writings, schisms, and heresies,
General Councils, eras of corruption (under which
head the remarks would be general), and I thought
possibly an application of the apocalyptic prophecies,
which would merely require a few figures and not take
up room. I think there must be a break in the chart
after the establishment of Christianity as the religion
of the empire, and I have come to a determination not
to carry it beyond the first acknowledgment of the supremacy
of the Pope by Phocas, in 606, when Mohammedanism
became a besom of destruction in the hand
of the Lord, and completely altered the aspect of ecclesiastical
history. So much for this, at present, airy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
project, about which I hope never to tease you more.
Mr. Harper<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
lent me a little time ago a work by the
Rev. W. Gresley, begging me to read it, as he thought
it was calculated to make me a proselyte to the opinions
it advocates. I had skimmed the book before
("Portrait of an English Churchman"), but I read it
attentively a second time, and was pleased with the
spirit of piety that breathes throughout. His last
work is one in a similar style ("The English Citizen"),
which I have cursorily read; and, as they are both
likely to be seen by you, I want to know your opinion
of them. Mine is this: that they are sure to have a
powerful influence on the minds of small readers and
shallow thinkers, as, from the simplicity and clearness
with which the author, by his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau-idéal</i> characters,
enunciates his sentiments, they furnish a magazine of
easily wielded weapons for <i>morning-calling</i> and <i>evening-party</i>
controversialists, as well as that really honest
minds will be inclined to think they have found a resting-place
amid the footballing of religious parties.
But it appears to me that there is unfairness in arbitrarily
selecting a train of circumstances and a set of
characters as a development of a class of opinions.
In this way we might make atheism appear wonderfully
calculated to promote social happiness. I remember,
as I dare say you do, a very amiable atheist
depicted by Bulwer in "Devereux;" and for some
time after the perusal of that book, which I read seven
or eight years ago,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
I was considerably shaken by the
impression that religion was not a requisite to moral
excellence.</p>

<p>Have you not alternating seasons of mental stagnation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and activity? just such as the political economists
say there must be in a nation's pecuniary condition&mdash;all
one's precious specie, Time, going out to procure a
stock of commodities, while one's own manufactures
are too paltry to be worth vending. I am just in that
condition&mdash;partly, I think, owing to my not having
met with any steel to sharpen my edge against for the
last three weeks. I am going to read a volume of the
Oxford Tracts and the "Lyra Apostolica;" the former
I almost shrink from the labor of conning, but the
other I confess I am attracted towards by some highly
poetical extracts that I have picked up in various
quarters. I have just bought Mr. Keble's "Christian
Year," a volume of sweet poetry that perhaps you
know. The fields of poesy look more lovely than
ever, now I have hedged myself in the geometrical regions
of fact, where I can do nothing but draw parallels
and measure differences in a double sense.</p>

A second important intimation respecting my
worthy self is one that, I confess, I impart without
one sigh, though perhaps you will think my callousness
discreditable. It is that Seeley &amp; Burnside have
just published a Chart of Ecclesiastical History,
doubtless giving to my airy vision a local habitation
and a name. I console all my little regrets by thinking
that what is thus evidenced to be a desideratum
has been executed much better than if left to my slow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
fingers and slower head. I fear I am laboriously doing
nothing, for I am beguiled by the fascination that
the study of languages has for my capricious mind. I
could e'en give myself up to making discoveries in the
world of words.</p>

<p>May I trouble you to procure for me an Italian book
recommended by Mr. Brezzi&mdash;Silvio Pellico's "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Le mie
Prigioni</span>;" if not, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Storia d'Italia</span>"? If they are cheap,
I should like both.</p>

<p>I shall have, I hope, a little trip with my father
next week into Derbyshire, and this "lark" will probably
be beneficial to me; so do not imagine I am inviting
you to come and hear moaning, when you need
all attainable relaxation.</p>

<p>Your letter greeted me last night on my arrival from
Staffordshire. The prospectus of Mr. Henslow's work
is as marvellous to my ignorant conceptions as the
prophecies of the wonders of the steam-engine would
have been to some British worthy in the days of Caractacus.
I can only gape as he would probably have
done. I hope Mr. H. has not imitated certain show-keepers,
who give so exaggerated a representation of
their giantess, on the outside, that the spectators have
disappointment for their cash within.</p>

<p>If I do not see you, how shall I send your "Don
Quixote," which I hope soon to finish? I have been
sadly interrupted by other books that have taken its
scanty allowance of time, or I should have made better
haste with it. Will you try to get me Spenser's
"Faery Queen"? the cheapest edition, with a glossary,
which is quite indispensable, together with a clear and
correct type. I have had some treats on my little excursion,
not the least of which was the gazing on some&mdash;albeit
the smallest&mdash;of the "everlasting hills," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
on those noblest children of the earth, fine, healthy
trees, as independent in their beauty as virtue; set
them where you will, they adorn, and need not adornment.
Father indulged me with a sight of Ashborne
Church, the finest mere parish church in the kingdom&mdash;in
the <em>interior</em>; of Alton Gardens, where I saw actually
what I have often seen mentally&mdash;the bread-fruit
tree, the fan-palm, and the papyrus; and last, of Lichfield
Cathedral, where, besides the exquisite architectural
beauties, both external and internal, I saw Chantrey's
famous monument of the Sleeping Children.
There is a tasteless monument to the learned and
brilliant female pedant of Lichfield, Miss Seward, with
a poor epitaph by Sir Walter Scott. In the town we
saw a large monument erected to Johnson's memory,
showing his Titanic body, in a sitting posture, on the
summit of a pedestal which is ornamented with bas-reliefs
of three passages in his life: his penance in
Uttoxeter Market, his chairing on the shoulders of his
schoolmates, and his listening to the preaching of
Sacheverel. The statue is opposite to the house in
which Johnson was born&mdash;altogether inferior to that
in St. Paul's, which shook me almost as much as a
real glance from the literary monarch. I am ashamed
to send you so many ill-clothed nothings. My excuse
shall be a state of head that calls for four leeches before
I can attack Mrs. Somerville's "Connection of
the Physical Sciences."</p>

both this, and many other defects in my letter,

<p>I believe it is decided that father and I should leave
Griff and take up our residence somewhere in the
neighborhood of Coventry, if we can obtain a suitable
house, and this is at present a matter of anxiety. So
you see I am likely still to have a home where I can
independently welcome you. I am really so plunged
in an abyss of books, preserves, and sundry <i>important
trivialities</i>, that I must send you this bare proof that I
have not cast the remembrance of you to a dusty corner
of my heart. Ever believe that "my heart is as
thy heart," that you may rely on me as a second self,
and that I shall, with my usual selfishness, lose no opportunity
of gratifying my duplicate.</p>

<p>The Epistle to the Colossians is pre-eminently rich
in the coloring with which it portrays the divine fulness
contained in the Saviour, contrasted with the beggarly
elements that a spirit of self-righteousness would,
in some way, mingle with the light of life, the filthy
rags it would tack round the "fine raiment" of his
righteousness. I have been reading it in connection
with a train of thought suggested by the reading of
"Ancient Christianity and the Oxford Tracts," by Isaac
Taylor, one of the most eloquent, acute, and pious of
writers. Five numbers only have yet appeared. Have
you seen them? If not, I should like to send you an
abstract of his argument. I have gulped it (pardon
my coarseness) in a most reptile-like fashion. I must
<em>chew</em> it thoroughly to facilitate its assimilation with my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
mental frame. When your pupils can relish Church
history, I venture to recommend the chart lately published
by Seeley &amp; Burnside&mdash;far superior in conception
to mine&mdash;as being more compendious, yet answering
the purpose of presenting epochs as nuclei
round which less important events instinctively cluster.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mrs. John Cash of Coventry, who was then Miss
Mary Sibree, daughter of a Nonconformist minister
there, and whose acquaintance Miss Evans made a
year or two later in Coventry, writes in regard to
this book of Isaac Taylor's: "In her first conversations
with my father and mother, they were much
interested in learning in what high estimation she
held the writings of Isaac Taylor. My father
<em>thought</em> she was a little disappointed on hearing that
he was a Dissenter. She particularly enjoyed his
'Saturday Evening,' and spoke in years after to
me of his 'Physical Theory of Another Life,' as
exciting thought and leading speculation further
than he would have desired. When his 'Ancient
Christianity' was published in numbers, Miss Evans
took it in, and kindly forwarded the numbers to us.
From the impression made on my own mind by unfavorable
facts about 'The Fathers,' and from her
own subsequent references to this work, I am inclined
to think it had its influence in unsettling her
views of Christianity."</p></blockquote>

<p>I have thought of you as <em>the</em> one who has ever shown
herself so capable of consideration for my weakness
and sympathy in my warm and easily fastened affections.
My imagination is an enemy that must be cast
down ere I can enjoy peace or exhibit uniformity of
character. I know not which of its caprices I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
most to dread&mdash;that which incites it to spread sackcloth
"above, below, around," or that which makes it
"cheat my eye with blear illusion, and beget strange
dreams" of excellence and beauty in beings and things
of only working-day price. The beautiful heavens that
we have lately enjoyed awaken in me an indescribable
sensation of exultation in existence, and aspiration after
all that is suited to engage an immaterial nature.
I have not read very many of Mr. B.'s poems, nor any
with much attention. I simply declare my determination
not to feed on the broth of literature when I
can get strong soup&mdash;such, for instance, as Shelley's
"Cloud," the five or six stanzas of which contain more
poetic metal than is beat out in all Mr. B.'s pages.
You must know I have had bestowed on me the very
pretty cognomen of Clematis, which, in the floral language,
means "mental beauty." I cannot find in my
heart to refuse it, though, like many other appellations,
it has rather the appearance of a satire than a compliment.
<i>Addio!</i> I will send your floral name in my next,
when I have received my dictionary. My hand and
mind are wearied with writing four pages of German
and a letter of business.</p>

I heard the "Messiah" on Thursday morning at Birmingham,
and some beautiful selections from other

over damson cheese and a warm stove, I cannot do better
than ask you to read, if accessible, Wordsworth's

I have just been delighted. I have made an alteration
in my plans with Mr. Brezzi, and shall henceforward
take Italian and German alternately, so that I
shall not be liable to the consciousness of having
imperative employment for every interstice of time.
There seems a greater affinity between German and
my mind than Italian, though less new to me, possesses.</p>

<p>I am reading Schiller's "Maria Stuart," and Tasso.</p>

<p>I was pleased with a little poem I learned a week
or two ago in German; and, as I want you to like it, I
have just put the idea it contains into English doggerel,
which quite fails to represent the beautiful simplicity
and nature of the original, but yet, I hope, will
give you sufficiently its sense to screen the odiousness
of the translation. <i>Eccola</i>:</p>

the landscape.... There comes a crowd of burly navvies
with pickaxes and barrows, and while hardly a wrinkle
is made in the fading mother's face, or a new curve of
health in the blooming girl's, the hills are cut through,
or the breaches between them spanned, we choose our
level, and the white steam-pennon flies along it."</p>

<p>My only reason for writing is to obtain a timely
promise that you will spend your holidays chiefly with
me, that we may once more meet among scenes which,
now I am called on to leave them, I find to have
<em>grown in</em> to my affections. Carlyle says that to the
artisans of Glasgow the world is not one of blue skies
and a green carpet, but a world of copperas-fumes,
low cellars, hard wages, "striking," and whiskey; and if
the recollection of this picture did not remind me that
gratitude should be my reservoir of feeling, that into
which all that comes from above or around should be
received as a source of fertilization for my soul, I
should give a lachrymose parody of the said description,
and tell you all-seriously what I now tell you
playfully, that mine is too often a world such as Wilkie
can so well paint, a walled-in world furnished with all
the details which he remembers so accurately, and the
least interesting part whereof is often what I suppose
must be designated the intelligent; but I deny that it
has even a comparative claim to the appellation, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
give me a three-legged stool, and it will call up associations&mdash;moral,
poetical, mathematical&mdash;if I do but ask
it, while some human beings have the odious power of
contaminating the very images that are enshrined as
our soul's arcana. Their baleful touch has the same
effect as would a uniformity in the rays of light&mdash;it
turns all objects to pale lead-color. O how luxuriously
joyous to have the wind of heaven blow on one after
being <em>stived</em> in a human atmosphere&mdash;to feel one's
heart leap up after the pressure that Shakespeare so
admirably describes: "When a man's wit is not seconded
by the forward chick understanding, it strikes a
man as dead as a large reckoning in a small room."
But it is time I check this Byronic invective, and, in doing
so, I am reminded of Corinne's, or rather Oswald's,
reproof&mdash;"La vie est un <em>combat</em> pas un <em>hymne</em>." We
should aim to be like a plant in the chamber of sickness&mdash;dispensing
purifying air even in a region that
turns all pale its verdure, and cramps its instinctive
propensity to expand. Society is a wide nursery of
plants, where the hundreds decompose to nourish the
future ten, after giving collateral benefits to their contemporaries
destined for a fairer garden. An awful
thought! one so heavy that if our souls could once
sustain its whole weight, or, rather, if its whole weight
were once to drop on them, they would break and
burst their tenements. How long will this continue?
The cry of the martyrs heard by St. John finds an echo
in every heart that, like Solomon's, groans under "the
outrage and oppression with which earth is filled."
Events are now so momentous, and the elements of
society in so chemically critical a state, that a drop
seems enough to change its whole form.</p>

But this wrought-up sensitiveness which makes me

<p>Happily, the moody, melancholy temperament has
some counterbalancing advantages to those of the sanguine:
it <em>does</em> sometimes meet with results more favorable

<p>On Monday and Tuesday my father and I were occupied
with the sale of furniture at our new house: it
is probable that we shall migrate thither in a month.
I shall be incessantly hurried until after our departure,
but at present I have to be grateful for a smooth passage
through contemplated difficulties. Sewing is my
staple article of commerce with the hard trader, Time.
Now the wind has veered to the south I hope to do
much more, and that with greater zest than I have
done for many months&mdash;I mean, of all kinds.</p>

<p>I have been reading the three volumes of the "Life

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
quite martial in my spirit, and, in the warmth of
my sympathy for Turenne and Condé, losing my hatred
of war. Such a conflict between <em>individual</em> and <em>moral</em>
influence is no novelty. But certainly war, though the
heaviest scourge with which the divine wrath against
sin is manifested in Time, has been a necessary vent
for impurities and a channel for tempestuous passions
that must have otherwise made the whole earth, like
the land of the devoted Canaanites, to vomit forth the
inhabitants thereof. Awful as such a sentiment appears,
it seems to me that in the present condition of
man (and I do not mean this in the sense that Cowper
does), such a purgation of the body politic is probably
essential to its health. A foreign war would soon put
an end to our national humors, that are growing to so
alarming a head.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<blockquote><p>New circumstances now created a change almost
amounting to a revolution in Miss Evans's life.
Mr. Isaac Evans, who had been associated for some
time with his father in the land-agency business,
married, and it was arranged that he should take
over the establishment at Griff. This led to the
removal in March, 1841, of Mr. Robert Evans and
his daughter to a house on the Foleshill road, in
the immediate neighborhood of Coventry. The
house is still standing, although considerably altered&mdash;a
semi-detached house with a good bit of
garden round it, and from its upper windows a wide
view over the surrounding country, the immediate
foreground being unfortunately, however, disfigured
by the presence of mills and chimneys. It is town
life now instead of country life, and we feel the effects
at once in the tone of the subsequent letters.
The friendships now formed with Mr. and Mrs.
Bray and Miss Sara Hennell particularly, and the
being brought within reach of a small circle of cultivated
people generally, render this change of
residence an exceedingly important factor in George
Eliot's development. It chanced that the new
house was next door to Mrs. Pears', a sister of Mr.
Bray, and as there had been some acquaintance in
days gone by between him and the family at Griff,
this close neighborhood led to an exchange of visits.
The following extracts from letters to Miss Lewis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
show how the acquaintance ripened, and will give
some indications of the first impressions of Coventry
life:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to Miss
Lewis,
Saturday
evening,
April, 1841.</div>

<p>Last evening I mentioned you to my neighbor (Mrs.
Pears), who is growing into the more precious character
of a friend. I have seriously to be thankful for far
better health than I have possessed, I think, for years,
and I am imperatively called on to trade diligently
with this same talent. I am likely to be more and
more busy, if I succeed in a project that is just now
occupying my thoughts and feelings. I seem to be
tried in a contrary mode to that in which most of my
dearest friends are being tutored&mdash;tried in the most
dangerous way&mdash;by prosperity. Solomon says, "In
the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity
consider." It seems to me that a transposition,
<i>vice versâ</i>, of the admonitions would be equally
salutary and just. Truly, as the prophet of Selwyn
has told us, "Heaven is formidable in its favors."
Not that a wise and grateful reception of blessings
obliges us to stretch our faces to the length of one of
Cromwell's Barebones; nor to shun that joyous, bird-like
enjoyment of things (which, though perishable as
to their actual existence, will be embalmed to eternity
in the precious spices of gratitude) that is distinct from
levity and voluptuousness. I am really crowded with

<p>The whole of last week was devoted to a
bride's-maid's<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
duties, and each day of this has been partially
occupied in paying or receiving visits. I have a calm
in sea and sky that I doubt not will ere long be interrupted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
This is not our rest, if we are among those
for whom there remaineth one, and to pass through
life without tribulation (or, as Jeremy Taylor beautifully
says, with only such a measure of it as may be
compared to an artificial discord in music, which
nurses the ear for the returning harmony) would leave
us destitute of one of the marks that invariably accompany
salvation, and of that fellowship in the sufferings
of the Redeemer which can alone work in us
a resemblance to one of the most prominent parts of
his divinely perfect character, and enable us to obey
the injunction, "In patience possess your souls." I
have often observed how, in secular things, active occupation
in procuring the necessaries of life renders
the character indifferent to trials not affecting that one
object. There is an analogous influence produced in
the Christian by a vigorous pursuit of duty, a determination
to work while it is day.</p>

<p>One of the penalties women must pay for modern
deference to their intellect is, I suppose, that they
must give reasons for their conduct, after the fashion
of men. The days are past for pleading a woman's
reason. The truth is, that the hinderances to my writing
have been like the little waves of the brooks that
look so lovely just now&mdash;they have arisen one after
another close to my side, but when I have looked
back I have found the ripples too insignificant to be
marked in the distance. My father's longer <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séjours</i> at
home than formerly, and multiplied acquaintances
and engagements, are really valid excuses for me
hitherto, but I do not intend to need them in future;
I hope to be a "snapper-up of unconsidered" moments.
I have just been interrupted by a visit from
a lass of fourteen, who has despoiled me of half an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
hour, and I am going out to dinner, so that I cannot
follow the famous advice, "Hasten slowly." I suppose
that you framed your note on the principle that a
sharp and sudden sound is the most rousing, but there
are <i>addenda</i> about yourself that I want to know, though
I dare not ask for them. I do not feel settled enough
to write more at present. How is it that Erasmus
could write volumes on volumes and multifarious letters
besides, while I, whose labors hold about the same
relation to his as an ant-hill to a pyramid or a drop of
dew to the ocean, seem too busy to write a few? A
most posing query!</p>

<p>I have of late felt a depression that has disordered
the vision of my mind's eye and made me <em>alive</em> to what
is certainly a fact (though my imagination when I am
in health is an adept at concealing it), that I am <em>alone</em>
in the world. I do not mean to be so sinful as to say
that I have not friends <em>most</em> undeservedly kind and
tender, and disposed to form a far too favorable estimate
of me, but I mean that I have no one who enters
into my pleasures or my griefs, no one with whom I
can pour out my soul, no one with the same yearnings,
the same temptations, the same delights as myself. I
merely mention this as the impression that obtrudes
itself when my body tramples on its keeper&mdash;(a metaphor
borrowed from a menagerie of wild beasts, if it
should happen to puzzle you!)&mdash;mysterious "connection
exquisite of distant worlds" that we present! A
few drops of steel will perhaps make me laugh at the
simple objects that, in gloom and mist, I conjure into
stalking apparitions.</p>

<p>I have been revelling in Nichol's "Architecture of
the Heavens and Phenomena of the Solar System,"
and have been in imagination winging my flight from
system to system, from universe to universe, trying to
conceive myself in such a position and with such a
visual faculty as would enable me to enjoy what Young
enumerates among the novelties of the "Stranger"
man when he bursts the shell to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Behold an infinite of floating worlds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divide the crystal waves of ether pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In endless voyage without port."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Hospitable infinity!" Nichol beautifully says. How
should I love to have a thorough-going student with
me, that we might read together! We might each
alternately employ the voice and the fingers, and thus
achieve just twice as much as a poor solitary. I am
more impressed than ever with a truth beautifully expressed
in "Woman's Mission"&mdash;"Learning is only
so far valuable as it serves to enlarge and enlighten
the bounds of conscience." This I believe it eminently
does when pursued humbly and piously, and
from a belief that it is a solemn duty to cultivate every
faculty of our nature so far as primary obligations
allow. There is an exhortation of St. Paul's that I
should love to take as my motto: "Finally, my brethren,
whatsoever things are honest" (you know the continuation)&mdash;"if
there be <em>any</em> virtue, and if there be any
praise, think on these things." I have had to lament
lately that mine is not a <em>hard-working</em> mind&mdash;it requires
frequent rest. I am violently in love with the
Italian fashion of repeating an adjective or adverb,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and even noun, to give force to expression: there is
so much more fire in it than in our circumlocutory
phrases, our dull "verys" and "exceedinglys" and "extremelys."
I strongly recommend Hallam to you. I
shall read it again if I live. When a sort of haziness
comes over the mind, making one feel weary of articulated
or written signs of ideas, does not the notion of
a less laborious mode of communication, of a perception
approaching more nearly to intuition, seem attractive?
Nathless, I love words: they are the quoits,
the bows, the staves that furnish the gymnasium of the
mind. Without them, in our present condition, our
intellectual strength would have no implements. I
have been rather humbled in thinking that if I were
thrown on an uncivilized island, and had to form a
literature for its inhabitants from my own mental
stock, how very fragmentary would be the information
with which I could furnish them! It would be a good
mode of testing one's knowledge to set one's self the
task of writing sketches of all subjects that have entered
into one's studies entirely from the chronicles
of memory. The prevalence of misery and want in
this boasted nation of prosperity and glory is appalling,
and really seems to call us away from mental luxury.
O to be doing some little towards the regeneration
of this groaning, travailing creation! I am
supine and stupid&mdash;overfed with favors&mdash;while the
haggard looks and piercing glance of want and conscious
hopelessness are to be seen in the streets.</p>

<p>Is not this a true autumn day? Just the still melancholy
that I love&mdash;that makes life and nature harmonize.
The birds are consulting about their migrations,
the trees are putting on the hectic or the pallid hues

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
very footsteps may not disturb the repose of earth and
air, while they give us a scent that is a perfect anodyne

<p>I am going, I hope, to-day to effect a breach in the
thick wall of indifference behind which the denizens
of Coventry seem inclined to intrench themselves; but
I fear I shall fail.</p>

<blockquote><p>This probably refers to the first visit paid by
Miss Evans to Mr. and Mrs. Bray at their house.
They had met in the previous May at Mrs. Pears';
but although they were at once mutually attracted,
the acquaintance does not seem to have been immediately
prosecuted further. Now, however, any
time lost in the beginning was quickly made up,
and it is astonishing how rapidly the most intimate
relations were formed. Mr. Bray was a ribbon-manufacturer,
well-to-do at that time, and had a
charming house, Rosehill, with a beautiful lawn
and garden, in the outskirts of Coventry. Only a
part of his time was occupied with his business,
and he had much leisure and opportunity, of which
he availed himself, for liberal self-education and
culture. His was a robust, self-reliant mind. Already,
in 1839, he had published a work on the
"Education of the Feelings," viewed from the
phrenological standpoint; and in this year, 1841,
appeared his most important book, "The Philosophy
of Necessity." He always remained a sincere
and complete believer in the science of phrenology.
He had married Miss Caroline Hennell,
sister of the Mr. Charles Hennell who published,
in 1838, "An Inquiry Concerning the Origin of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Christianity"&mdash;a remarkable book, which was translated
into German, Strauss contributing a preface
to the translation. It will be seen from subsequent
letters how greatly Miss Evans was interested in
this book&mdash;how much she admired it; and the
reading of it, combined with the association with her
new friends&mdash;with the philosophical speculations
of Mr. Bray, and with Mrs. Bray's sympathy in her
brother's critical and sceptical standpoint&mdash;no
doubt hastened the change in her attitude towards
the dogmas of the old religion. In the Analytical
Catalogue of Mr. Chapman's publications, issued
in 1852, there is an analysis of Hennell's "Inquiry,"
done by Miss Evans, which may be inserted
here, as giving her idea of the book eleven years
later.</p></blockquote>

<p>"The first edition of this work appeared in 1838,
when the present strong current of public opinion in
favor of free religious discussion had not yet set in;
and it probably helped to generate the tone of thought
exhibited in more recent works of the same class, to
which circumstances have given a wider fame&mdash;works
which, like the above, in considering questions of Biblical
criticism and the philosophy of Christianity, combine
high refinement, purity of aim, and candor, with
the utmost freedom of investigation, and with a popularity
of style which wins them the attention not only
of the learned but of the practical.</p>

<p>"The author opens his inquiry with an historical
sketch, extending from the Babylonish Captivity to the
end of the first century, the design of which is to show
how, abstracting the idea of the miraculous, or any
speciality of divine influence, the gradual development
of certain elements in Jewish character, and the train
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of events in Jewish history, contributed to form a suitable
<i>nidus</i> for the production of a character and career
like that of Jesus, and how the devoted enthusiasm
generated by such a career in his immediate disciples,
rendering it easier for them to modify their ideas of
the Messiah than to renounce their belief in their Master's
Messiahship&mdash;the accession of Gentile converts
and the destruction of the last remnant of theocracy,
necessitating a wider interpretation of Messianic hopes&mdash;the
junction of Christian ideas with Alexandrian Platonism,
and the decrepitude of polytheism, combined
to associate the name of Jesus, his Messiahship, his
death and his resurrection, with a great moral and religious
revolution. This historical sketch, which is under
the disadvantage of presenting, synthetically, ideas
based on a subsequent analysis, is intended to meet
the difficulty so often urged, and which might be held
to nullify the value of a critical investigation, that
Christianity is a fact for which, if the supposition of a
miraculous origin be rejected, no adequate and probable
causes can be assigned, and that thus, however defective
may be the evidence of the New-Testament
history, its acceptance is the least difficult alternative.</p>

<p>"In the writer's view, the characteristics of the Essene
sect, as traced by Josephus and Philo, justify the
supposition that Jesus was educated in their school of
philosophy; but with the elevated belief and purity of
life which belonged to this sect he united the ardent
patriotic ideas which had previously animated Judas
of Galilee, who resisted the Roman authority on the
ground that God was the only ruler and lord of the
Jews. The profound consciousness of genius, a religious
fervor which made the idea of the divine ever
present to him, patriotic zeal, and a spirit of moral reform,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
together with a participation in the enthusiastic
belief of his countrymen that the long-predicted exaltation
of Israel was at hand, combined to produce in
the mind of Jesus the gradual conviction that he was
himself the Messiah, with whose reign that exaltation
would commence. He began, as John the Baptist had
already done, to announce 'the kingdom of heaven,' a
phrase which, to the Jewish mind, represented the national
glorification of Israel; and by his preaching,
and the influence of his powerful personality, he won
multitudes in Galilee to a participation in his belief
that he was the expected Son of David. His public
entrance into Jerusalem in the guise which tradition
associated with the Messiah, when he sanctioned the
homage of the multitude, was probably the climax of
his confidence that a great demonstration of divine
power, in concurrence with popular enthusiasm, would
seat him triumphantly on the throne of David. No
such result appearing, his views of the divine dispensation
with respect to himself began to change, and he
felt the presentiment that he must enter on his Messianic
reign through the gates of suffering and death.
Viewing Jesus as a pretender not only to spiritual but
to political power, as one who really expected the subversion
of the existing government to make way for
his own kingship (though he probably relied on divine
rather than on human means), he must necessarily
have appeared in a dangerous light to those of his
countrymen who were in authority, and who were anxious
at any price to preserve public tranquillity in the
presence of the Roman power, ready to visit with
heavy vengeance any breach of order, and to deprive
them of the last remnants of their independence; and
hence the motives for his arrest and execution. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
account for the belief of the disciples in the resurrection
of their Master&mdash;a belief which appears to have
been sincere&mdash;the author thinks it necessary to suppose
a certain nucleus of fact, and this he finds in the
disappearance of the body of Jesus, a point attested
by all the four evangelists. The secret of this disappearance
probably lay with Joseph of Arimathæa and
Nicodemus, who were anxious to avoid implicating
themselves with that fermentation of regretful enthusiasm
to which a resort of the disciples to the grave
might give rise. Animated by a belief in the resurrection,
which, being more harmless in the eyes of the
authorities than that in a living Messiah, they were
permitted to preach with little molestation; the zeal of
the disciples won many converts; a new impulse was
given to their cause by the accession of Paul, who became
the chief missionary of the new faith, as construed
by himself, to the Gentiles; and the concurrence of the
causes indicated above, modifying the early creed of
the apostles, and blending it with trains of thought already
prevalent, bore along Christianity in its conquest
over the minds of men until it became the dominant
religion of the Roman world.</p>

<p>"Having sought to show, in this preliminary sketch,
that a belief in miracles is not entailed on us by the
fact of the early growth of Christianity, the author enters
on the inquiry whether the claims of the evangelical
writers on our credence are such as to sustain the
miraculous part of their narratives. The answer is in
the negative. He discusses, first, the date and credibility
of each Gospel, and concludes that while Matthew
has many marvellous stories, incongruous in themselves,
and not only unsupported but contradicted by
the other evangelists, he nevertheless presents the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
comprehensible account of the career of Jesus; that
in Mark, evidently more remote in time and circumstances,
both from his events and from Jewish modes
of thought, the idea conveyed of Jesus is much vaguer
and less explicable; that in Luke there is a still further
modification of his character, which has acquired
a tinge of asceticism; while in John the style of his
teaching is wholly changed, and instead of the graphic
parable and the pithy apothegm, he utters long, mystical
discourses in the style of the first epistle bearing
the name of the same evangelist. Mr. Hennell, however,
adheres to the conclusion that the substance of
this Gospel came from the apostle John at an advanced
age, when both the events of his early manhood and
the scenes of his native land lay in the far distance.
The writer then enters on a special examination of the
Resurrection and Ascension, and the other miracles in
the Gospels and the Acts, and inquires how far they
are sustained by the apostolic Epistles. He examines
the prophecies of the Old Testament supposed to have
been fulfilled in Jesus, and also the predictions of
Jesus himself concerning his death and resurrection;
and, finally, he considers the character, views, and doctrine
of Christ. According to him, an impartial study
of the conduct and sayings of Jesus, as exhibited in
the Gospels, produces the conviction that he was an
enthusiast and a revolutionist, no less than a reformer
and a moral and religious teacher. Passages are adduced
from the Old Testament, and from the apocryphal
and rabbinical writings, to show that there is
scarcely anything absolutely original in the teaching
of Jesus; but, in the opinion of the author, he manifests
a freedom and individuality in the use of his materials,
and a general superiority of tone and selection,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
which, united with the devotion of his life to what he
held the highest purpose, mark him to be of an order
of minds occurring but at rare intervals in the history
of our race.</p>

<p>"Shortly after the appearance of this work it was
translated into German through the instrumentality of
Dr. Strauss, who, in the preface he prefixed to it, says:
'Not sufficiently acquainted with German to read continuously
a learned work in that language, the labors
of our theologians were only accessible to him' (the
author of the 'Inquiry') 'so far as they were written
in Latin, or translated into English, or treated of in
English writings or periodicals: especially he is unacquainted
with what the Germans have effected in the
criticism of the gospels since Schleiermacher's work
on Luke, and even the earlier commentators he knows
but imperfectly. Only so much the more remarkable
is it, however, that both in the principles and in the
main results of his investigation, he is on the very
track which has been entered on among us in recent
years.... That at certain periods, certain modes of
thought lie as it were in the atmosphere, ... and come
to light in the most remote places without perceptible
media of communication, is shown, not only by the
contents, but by the spirit, of Mr. Hennell's work. No
further traces of the ridicule and scorn which characterize
his countrymen of the deistical school; the subject
is treated in the earnest and dignified tone of the
truth-seeker, not with the rancor of a passionate polemic;
we nowhere find him deriving religion from
priestcraft, but from the tendencies and wants of human
nature.... These elevated views, which the learned
German of our day appropriates as the fruit of the religious
and scientific advancement of his nation, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Englishman, to whom most of the means at our command
were wanting, has been able to educe entirely
from himself.... An Englishman, a merchant, a man
of the world, he possesses, both by nature and by training,
the practical insight, the sure tact, which lays hold
on realities. The solution of problems over which the
German flutters with many circuits of learned formulæ,
our English author often succeeds in seizing at one
spring.... To the learned he often presents things
under a surprisingly new aspect; to the unlearned, invariably
under that which is the most comprehensible
and attractive.'"</p>

<blockquote><p>The reading of Mr. Hennell's book no doubt
marks an epoch in George Eliot's development;
but probably there had been a good deal of half-unconscious
preparation beforehand (as indicated
by Mrs. Cash's remarks on Isaac Taylor's work, in
the last chapter), which was greatly stimulated now
by the contact with new minds. The following extract
from a letter to Miss Lewis, dated 13th
November, 1841, accurately fixes the date of the
first acknowledgment by herself that her opinions
were undergoing so momentous a change.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It was impossible for such a nature as Miss
Evans's, in the enthusiasm of this first great change,
to rest satisfied in compliance with the old forms,
and she was so uneasy in an equivocal position
that she determined to give up going to church.
This was an unforgivable offence in the eyes of her
father, who was a Churchman of the old school, and
nearly led to a family rupture. He went so far as
to put into an agent's hands the lease of the house
in the Foleshill road, with the intention of going to
live with his married daughter. Upon this, Miss
Evans made up her mind to go into lodgings at
Leamington, and to try to support herself by teaching.

<p>We have not, perhaps, been so systematic as a regular
tutor and pupil would have been, but we crave indulgence
for some laxity. I was really touched that you
should think of <em>me</em> while among friends more closely
linked with you in every way. I was beginning to get
used to the conviction that, ivy-like as I am by nature,
I must (as we see ivy do sometimes) shoot out into an
isolated tree. Never again imagine that you need ask
forgiveness for speaking or writing to me on subjects
to me more interesting than aught else; on the contrary,
believe that I really enjoy conversation of this
nature: blank silence and cold reserve are the only
bitters I care for in my intercourse with you. I can
rejoice in all the joys of humanity; in all that serves
to elevate and purify feeling and action; nor will I
quarrel with the million who, I am persuaded, are with
me in intention, though our dialects differ. Of course,
I must desire the ultimate downfall of error, for no
error is innocuous; but this assuredly will occur without
my proselytizing aid, and the best proof of a real
love of the truth&mdash;that freshest stamp of divinity&mdash;is a
calm confidence in its intrinsic power to secure its
own high destiny, that of universal empire. Do not
fear that I will become a stagnant pool by a self-sufficient
determination only to listen to my own echo; to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
read the yea, yea, on my own side, and be most comfortably
deaf to the nay, nay. Would that all rejected
<em>practically</em> this maxim! To <em>fear</em> the examination of
any proposition appears to me an intellectual and a
moral palsy that will ever hinder the firm grasping of
any substance whatever. For my part, I wish to be
among the ranks of that glorious crusade that is seeking
to set Truth's Holy Sepulchre free from a usurped
domination. We shall then see her resurrection!
Meanwhile, although I cannot rank among my principles
of action a fear of vengeance eternal, gratitude
for predestined salvation, or a revelation of future
glories as a reward, I fully participate in the belief that
the only heaven here, or hereafter, is to be found in
conformity with the will of the Supreme; a continual
aiming at the attainment of the perfect ideal, the true
<i>logos</i> that dwells in the bosom of the one Father. I
hardly know whether I am ranting after the fashion of

pronounced to possess a large organ of "adhesiveness,"
a still larger one of "firmness," and as large of

<p>Beautiful egoism, to quote one's own. But where is
not this same ego? The martyr at the stake seeks its
gratification as much as the court sycophant, the difference
lying in the comparative dignity and beauty of
the two egos. People absurdly talk of self-denial.
Why, there is none in virtue, to a being of moral excellence:
the greatest torture to such a soul would be
to run counter to the dictates of conscience; to wallow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>

<p>I have had a weary week. At the beginning more
than the usual amount of <em>cooled</em> glances, and exhortations
to the suppression of self-conceit. The former
are so many hailstones that make me wrap more closely
around me the mantle of determinate purpose: the
latter are needful, and have a tendency to exercise forbearance,
that well repays the temporary smart. The
heart knoweth its own, whether bitterness or joy: let
us, dearest, beware how we, <em>even with good intentions</em>,

<p>I must relieve my conscience before I go to bed by
entering a protest against every word or accent of discontent
that I uttered this morning. If I have ever
complained of any person or circumstance, I do penance
by eating my own words. When my real self
has regained its place, I can shake off my troubles "like
dewdrops from the lion's mane," and then I feel the
baseness of imputing my sorrows to others rather than
to my own pitiful weakness. But I do not write for
your forgiveness; that I know I have. I only want
to satisfy my indignation against myself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs.
Pears,
Thursday,
Mch. 1842.</div>

<p>I have just been climbing up some favorite old hills,
or rather hillocks, and if I could see you I should find
myself in high preparation for one of my thorough chats.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Oh, if I could transport myself to your dining-room,
where I guess you and Mr. Pears are sitting in anticipation
of tea&mdash;carrying on no "holy war," but at peace
with the world and its opinions, or, if ever you do battle,
in the happy ranks of the majority&mdash;I could kiss you
into sublime liberality! How are you and your dear
husband and children? It seems a week of years instead
of days since you said to me your kind good-bye,
and as I have tried your magnanimity quite long enough
to be assured that you will not let me hear of you without
a beseeching letter from me, I snatch half an hour
from a too short day for the generous purpose of doubly
qualifying myself, first, by pouring out the contents
of my gossip-wallet, and then quietly awaiting the news
I want to hear of you. I have here, in every way, abundant
and unlooked-for blessings&mdash;delicacy and consideration
from all whom I have seen; and I really begin
to recant my old belief about the indifference of all
the world towards me, for my acquaintances of this
neighborhood seem to seek an opportunity of smiling
on me in spite of my heresy. All these things,
however, are but the fringe and ribbons of happiness.
They are <em>ad</em>herent, not <em>in</em>herent; and, without any
affectation, I feel myself to be acquiring what I
must hold to be a precious possession, an independence
of what is baptized by the world external good.
There are externals (at least, they are such in common
thought) that I could ill part with&mdash;the deep,
blue, glorious heavens, bending as they do over all,
presenting the same arch, emblem of a truer omnipresence,
wherever we may be chased, and all the sweet,
peace-breathing sights and sounds of this lovely earth.
These, and the thoughts of the good and great, are an
inexhaustible world of delight; and the felt desire to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
be one in will and design with the great mind that has
laid open to us these treasures is the sun that warms
and fructifies it. I am more and more impressed
with the duty of <em>finding</em> happiness. On a retrospection
of the past month, I regret nothing so much as
my own impetuosity both of feeling and judging. I
am not inclined to be sanguine as to my dear father's
future determination, and I sometimes have an intensely
vivid consciousness, which I only allow to be a
fleeting one, of all that is painful and that has been so.
I can only learn that my father has commenced his
alterations at Packington, but he only appears to be
temporarily acquiescing in my brother's advice "not
to be in a hurry." I do not intend to remain here
longer than three weeks, or, at the very farthest, a
month; and, if I am not then recalled, I shall write
for definite directions. I must have a <em>home</em>, not a visiting-place.
I wish you would learn something from
my father, and send me word how he seems disposed.
I hope you get long walks on these beautiful days.
You would love to hear the choristers we have here;
they are hymning away incessantly. Can you not
drive over and see me? Do come by hook or by
crook. Why, Mr. Pears could almost walk hither. I
am becoming very hurried, for most welcome tea is in
the vicinity, and I must be busy after I have imbibed
its inspiration. You will write to me to-morrow, will you
not? and pray insist on Mr. Pears writing an appendix.
I had a note from Mrs. Bray this morning, and I liked
it better than my breakfast. So do give me a little
treat on Saturday. Blessings on you and yours, as all
forlorn beggars have said from time immemorial to
their benefactors; but real feeling, you know, will
sometimes slip into a hackneyed guise.

<blockquote><p>Miss Evans remained for about three weeks at
Griff, at the end of which time, through the intervention
of her brother, the Brays, and Miss Rebecca
Franklin, the father was very glad to receive
her again, and she resumed going to church as
before.</p>

<p>It will be seen from a subsequent noteworthy letter
to Miss Sara Hennell, dated 19th October, 1843,
that Miss Evans's views of the best course to be
pursued under similar circumstances had already
undergone considerable modifications, and in the
last year of her life she told me that, although she
did not think she had been to blame, few things had
occasioned her more regret than this temporary collision
with her father, which might, she thought,
have been avoided with a little management.</p>

<p>In July of this year (1842) Miss Sara Hennell&mdash;the
gifted sister of Mrs. Bray&mdash;came to Rosehill,
and completed the trio destined to exert the most
important influence over the life of George Eliot.
The individual characters of these three friends,
and the relations each bore to their correspondent,
will unfold themselves in the letters. It is only
necessary here to say that the two ladies&mdash;Cara
and Sara, as they are always addressed&mdash;now became
like sisters to Miss Evans, and Mr. Bray her
most intimate male friend, and the letters to them
form an almost unbroken chain during all the remainder
of George Eliot's life.</p>

<p>To us Miss Sara Hennell is the most important
correspondent, for it is to her that Miss Evans
mainly turns now for intellectual sympathy; to
Mrs. Bray when she is in pain or trouble, and
wants affectionate companionship; with Mr. Bray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
she quarrels, and the humorous side of her nature
is brought out. Every good story goes to him,
with a certainty that it will be appreciated. With
all three it is a beautiful and consistent friendship,
running like a thread through the woof of the coming
thirty-eight years. For the next twelve years, as
will be seen, it is quite the most important thread;
and although later it naturally became very much
less important, it was never dropped except for a
moment, in 1854, owing to a brief misunderstanding
of letters, which will appear in its due place.</p>

<p>The following letters to Miss Sara Hennell show
what was passing from 30th August, 1842, to April,
1843:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
30th Aug.
1842.</div>

<p>How I have delighted in the thought that there are
beings who are better than their promises, beyond the
regions of waking and sleeping dreams.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
Friday,
Sept. 1842.</div>

<p>I have not yet accounted for my tardiness in writing,
which, I assure you, is no representation of my
usual habit, and has been occasioned only by a week's
indisposition, the foster-parent to the ill-favored offspring
of my character and circumstances, gloom and
stolidity, and I could not write to you with such companions
to my thought. I am anxious that you should
not imagine me unhappy even in my most melancholy
moods, for I hold all indulgence of sadness that has
the slightest tincture of discontent to be a grave delinquency.
I think there can be few who more truly
feel than I that this is a world of bliss and beauty&mdash;that
is, that bliss and beauty are the end, the tendency
of creation; and evils are the shadows that are the
only conditions of light in the picture, and I live in
much, much enjoyment.</p>

<p>I am beginning to enjoy the "Eneid," though, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
suppose, much in the same way as the uninitiated enjoy
wine, compared with the connoisseurs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
3d Nov.
1842.</div>

<p>I have been in high displeasure with myself, have
thought my soul only fit for limbo, to keep company
with other abortions, and my life the shallowest, muddiest,
most unblessing stream. Having got my head
above this slough of despond, I feel quite inclined to
tell you how much pleasure your letter gave me. You
observe in your note that some persons say the unsatisfied
longing we feel in ourselves for something
better than the greatest perfection to be found on
earth is a proof that the true object of our desires lies
beyond it. Assuredly, this earth is not the home of
the spirit&mdash;it will rest only in the bosom of the Infinite.
But the non-satisfaction of the affections and
intellect being inseparable from the unspeakable advantage
of such a mind as that of man in connection
with his corporal condition and <i>terrene</i> destiny, forms
not at present an argument with me for the realization
of particular desires.</p>

<p>I cannot help wishing to tell you, now that you are in
trouble and anxiety, how dear you are to me, and how
the recollection of you is ever freshening in my mind.
You have need of all your cheeriness and energy;
and if they do not fail, I think it almost enviable, as
far as one's self is concerned (not, of course, when the
sufferer is remembered), to have the care of a sick-room,
with its twilight and tiptoe stillness and helpful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
activity. I have always had a peculiarly peaceful
feeling in such a scene.</p>

<blockquote><p>Again, after the death of Miss Mary Hennell,
there is a letter to her sister Sara:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
April, 1843.</div>

<p>We always find that our stock of appreciated good
can never be really diminished. When the chief desire
of the eyes is taken, we can afford a gaze to
hitherto unnoticed possessions; and even when the
topmost boughs are lopped, a thousand shoots spring
from below with the energy of new life. So it will be
with you; but you cannot yet look beyond the present,
nor is it desirable that you should. It would not be
well for us to overleap one grade of joy or suffering:
our life would lose its completeness and beauty.</p>

<blockquote><p>Rosehill not only afforded a pleasant variety in
the Coventry life, as most visitors to the town, of
any note, found their way there, but the Brays
were also frequently in the habit of making little
holiday excursions, in many of which Miss Evans
now joined. Thus we find them in May, 1843, all
going to Stratford and Malvern, together with Mr.
Charles Hennell and Miss Sara Hennell, for a
week; and again, in July of that year the same
party, accompanied by Miss Brabant, daughter of
Dr. Brabant of Devizes, went on a fortnight's tour,
visiting Tenby, among other places. This trip is
chiefly memorable from the fact that it was indirectly
responsible for Miss Evans undertaking the
translation of Strauss's "Leben Jesu." For Miss
Brabant (to whom the translation had been confided
by Mr. Joseph Parkes of Birmingham and a
group of friends) became engaged to be married
to Mr. Charles Hennell; and shortly after her
marriage she handed the work over to Miss Evans.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next two letters to Miss Sara Hennell
there are allusions to the approaching marriage,
which took place in London on 1st November,
1843, the Brays and Miss Evans being present.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many thanks for procuring me the hymns and anthems.
I was right glad to play "Ancient of Ages"
again, and I shall like still better to sing it with you
when we meet. That that is to be so soon, and under
circumstances so joyful, are among the <i>mirabilia</i> of
this changing world. To see and re-see such a cluster

the wedding gives, will be almost too large a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne-bouche</i>.</p>

<p>I saw Robert Owen yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. Bray

<p>I only wish you would change houses with the mayor,
that I might get to you when I would. I send you
the first part of "Wallenstein," with the proposition
that we should study that in conjunction with the
"Thirty Years' War," as I happen to have a loose
copy. We had better omit the "Lager," and begin
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Piccolomini.</span>" You shall have "Joan of Arc,"
my grand favorite, as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne-bouche</i> when you have
got through "Wallenstein," which will amply repay
you for any trouble in translating it, and is not more
difficult than your reading ought to be now. I have
skimmed Manzoni, who has suffered sadly in being
poured out of silver into pewter. The chapter on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Philosophy and Theology is worth reading. Miss
Brabant sent me my "Hyperion" with a note, the other
day. She had put no direction besides Coventry, and
the parcel had consequently been sent to some other
Miss Evans, and my choice little sentimental treasures,
alas! exposed to vulgar gaze. Thank you for
the manual, which I have had so long. I trust I did
not bestow those scratches on the cover. I have been
trying to find a French book that you were not likely
to have read, but I do not think I have one, unless it
be "Gil Blas," which you are perhaps too virtuous to
have read, though how any one can opine it to have a
vicious tendency I am at a loss to conjecture. They
might as well say that to condemn a person to eat a
whole plum-pudding would deprive him of all future
relish for plain food. I have had a visitor ever since
Saturday, and she will stay till Saturday again. I
cannot desire that you should <em>un</em>ask Violin and Flute,
unless a postponement would be in every way as
agreeable to you and them. If you have them, you
will give them much more pleasure as Piano than I,
so do not think of me in the matter for a moment.
Good-bye; and remember to treat your cold as if it
were an orphan's cold, or a widow's cold, or any one's
cold but your own.</p>

<blockquote><p>The following is the letter before referred to as
containing an important and noteworthy declaration
of opinion on the very interesting question
of conformity:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
9th Oct.
1843.</div>

<p>The first thing I have to say to you is to entreat that
you and Mrs. Hennell will not perplex yourselves for
a moment about my accommodation during the night.
I am so well now that a hearthrug would be as luxurious
a couch as I should need, and I defy anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
short of a kettledrum or my conscience to keep me
awake after a long day.</p>

<p>The subject of your conversation with Miss D&mdash;&mdash;
is a very important one, and worth an essay. I will
not now inflict one of mine on you, but I will tell you,
as briefly as possible, my present opinion, which you
know is contrary to the one I held in the first instance.
I am inclined to think that such a change of sentiment
is likely to happen to most persons whose views
on religious matters undergo a change early in life.
The first impulse of a young and ingenuous mind is
to withhold the slightest sanction from all that contains
even a mixture of supposed error. When the
soul is just liberated from the wretched giant's bed of
dogmas on which it has been racked and stretched
ever since it began to think, there is a feeling of exultation
and strong hope. We think we shall run
well when we have the full use of our limbs and the
bracing air of independence, and we believe that we
shall soon obtain something positive, which will not
only more than compensate us for what we have renounced,
but will be so well worth offering to others
that we may venture to proselytize as fast as our zeal
for truth may prompt us. But a year or two of reflection,
and the experience of our own miserable weakness,
which will ill afford to part even with the crutch
of superstition, must, I think, effect a change. Speculative
truth begins to appear but a shadow of individual
minds. Agreement between intellects seems
unattainable, and we turn to the <em>truth of feeling</em> as
the only universal bond of union. We find that the intellectual
errors which we once fancied were a mere
incrustation have grown into the living body, and that
we cannot, in the majority of cases, wrench them away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
without destroying vitality. We begin to find that
with individuals, as with nations, the only safe revolution
is one arising out of the wants which their own
progress has generated. It is the quackery of infidelity
to suppose that it has a nostrum for all mankind,
and to say to all and singular, "Swallow my opinions
and you shall be whole." If, then, we are debarred
by such considerations from trying to reorganize opinions,
are we to remain aloof from our fellow-creatures
on occasions when we may fully sympathize with the
feelings exercised, although our own have been melted
into another mould? Ought we not on every opportunity
to seek to have our feelings in harmony, though
not in union, with those who are often richer in the
fruits of faith, though not in reason, than ourselves?
The results of nonconformity in a family are just an
epitome of what happens on a larger scale in the
world. An influential member chooses to omit an
observance which, in the minds of all the rest, is associated
with what is highest and most venerable. He
cannot make his reasons intelligible, and so his conduct
is regarded as a relaxation of the hold that moral
ties had on him previously. The rest are infected
with the disease they imagine in him. All the screws
by which order was maintained are loosened, and in
more than one case a person's happiness may be
ruined by the confusion of ideas which took the form
of principles. But, it may be said, how then are we
to do anything towards the advancement of mankind?
Are we to go on cherishing superstitions out of a fear
that seems inconsistent with any faith in a Supreme
Being? I think the best and the only way of fulfilling
our mission is to sow good seed in good (<i>i.e.</i>, prepared)
ground, and not to root up tares where we must inevitably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
gather all the wheat with them. We cannot
fight and struggle enough for freedom of inquiry, and
we need not be idle in imparting all that is pure and
lovely to children whose minds are unbespoken. Those
who can write, let them do it as boldly as they like;
and let no one hesitate at proper seasons to make a
full <em>con</em>fession (far better than <em>pro</em>fession). St. Paul's
reasoning about the conduct of the strong towards the
weak, in the fourteenth and fifteenth chapters of
Romans, is just in point. But I have not said half
what I meant to say. There are so many aspects in
which the subject might be presented that it is useless
to attempt to exhaust it. I fear I have written
very unintelligibly, for it is rather late, and I am so
cold that my thoughts are almost frozen.</p>

<blockquote><p>After Miss Brabant's marriage to Mr. Charles
Hennell, Miss Evans went to stay for a week or
two with Dr. Brabant at Devizes, and some time
about the beginning of January, 1844, the proposition
was made for the transfer of the translation
of Strauss from Mrs. Charles Hennell. At the
end of April, 1844, Mrs. Bray writes to Miss Sara
Hennell that Miss Evans is "working away at
Strauss six pages a day," and the next letter from
Miss Evans refers to the beginning of the undertaking.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

Sunday,

<p>To begin with business, I send you on the other side
the translations you wished (Strauss), but they are
perhaps no improvements on what you had done. I
shall be very glad to learn from you the particulars as
to the mode of publication&mdash;who are the parties that
will find the funds, and whether the manuscripts are
to be put into the hands of any one when complete,
or whether they are to go directly from me to the publishers?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
I was very foolish not to imagine about these
things in the first instance, but ways and means are
always afterthoughts with me.</p>

<p>You will soon be settled and enjoying the blessed
spring and summer time. I hope you are looking forward
to it with as much delight as I. One has to
spend so many years in learning how to be happy. I
am just beginning to make some progress in the science,
and I hope to disprove Young's theory that "as
soon as we have found the key of life it opes the gates
of death." Every year strips us of at least one vain
expectation, and teaches us to reckon some solid good
in its stead. I never will believe that our youngest
days are our happiest. What a miserable augury for
the progress of the race and the destination of the individual
if the more matured and enlightened state is
the less happy one! Childhood is only the beautiful
and happy time in contemplation and retrospect: to
the child it is full of deep sorrows, the meaning of
which is unknown. Witness colic and whooping-cough
and dread of ghosts, to say nothing of hell and Satan,
and an offended Deity in the sky, who was angry when
I wanted too much plumcake. Then the sorrows of
older persons, which children see but cannot understand,
are worse than all. All this to prove that we
are happier than when we were seven years old, and
that we shall be happier when we are forty than we
are now, which I call a comfortable doctrine, and one
worth trying to believe! I am sitting with father, who
every now and then jerks off my attention to the history
of Queen Elizabeth, which he is reading.</p>

<p>Can I have the remaining volumes of Strauss, excepting
any part that you may choose to keep for your own
use? If you could also send me such parts of the introduction
and first section as you wish me to look
over, I should like to despatch that business at intervals,
when I am not inspired for more thorough labor.
Thank you for the encouragement you sent me. I
only need it when my head is weak and I am unable
to do much. Then I sicken at the idea of having
Strauss in my head and on my hands for a lustrum,
instead of saying good-bye to him in a year. When I
can work fast I am never weary, nor do I regret either
that the work has been begun or that I have undertaken
it. I am only inclined to vow that I will never
translate again, if I live to correct the sheets for
Strauss. My first page is 257.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
31st Oct.

<p>Pray tell Mrs. C. Hennell that no apology was
needed for the very good translation she has sent me.
I shall be glad to avail myself of it to the last word,
for I am thoroughly tired of my own garb for Strauss's
thoughts. I hope the introduction, etc., will be ready
by the end of November, when I hope to have put the
last words to the first volume. I am awfully afraid of
my own translation, and I want you to come and comfort
me. I am relapsing into heathen darkness about
everything but Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
"Heaven has sent leanness into my soul"&mdash;for reviling
them, I suppose. This lovely autumn! Have you
enjoyed its long shadows and fresh breezes?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I do not think it was kind to Strauss (I knew he
was handsome) to tell him that a young lady was
translating his book. I am sure he must have some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
twinges of alarm to think he was dependent on that
most contemptible specimen of the human being for
his English reputation. By the way, I never said that
the Canons of the Council of Nice, or the Confession
of Augsburg, or even the Thirty-nine Articles, are
suggestive of poetry. I imagine no <em>dogmas</em> can be.
But surely Christianity, with its Hebrew retrospect
and millennial hopes, the heroism and divine sorrow
of its founder, and all its glorious army of martyrs,
might supply, and has supplied, a strong impulse not
only to poetry, but to all the Fine Arts. Mr. Pears is
coming home from Malvern to-night, and the children
are coming to tea with me, so that I have to make
haste with my afternoon matters. Beautiful little Susan
has been blowing bubbles, and looking like an
angel at sport. I am quite happy, only sometimes
feeling "the weight of all this unintelligible world."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Your books are come for the school, and I have
covered them&mdash;at least those that I think you will like
for the children; two or three are quite for grown-up
people. What an exquisite little thing that is of Harriet
Martineau's&mdash;"The Crofton Boys"! I have had
some delightful crying over it. There are two or three
lines in it that would feed one's soul for a month.
Hugh's mother says to him, speaking of people who
have permanent sorrow, "They soon had a new and
delicious pleasure, which none but the bitterly disappointed
can feel&mdash;the pleasure of rousing their souls
to bear pain, and of <em>agreeing with God silently</em>, when
nobody knows what is in their hearts." I received
"Sybil" yesterday quite safely. I am not utterly disgusted
with D'Israeli. The man hath good veins, as
Bacon would say, but there is not enough blood in
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>The 17th April this year was an interesting day,
as Miss Evans went with the Brays to Atherstone
Hall, and met Harriet Martineau for the first time.
It will be seen that in later years there was considerable
intimacy between them.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>If you think any of my future manuscript too untidy
for the printer, only mark it to that effect, and I will
rewrite it, for I do not mind that mechanical work;
and my conscience is rather uneasy lest the illegibility
of my hand should increase materially the expense of
the publication. Do not be alarmed because I am
not well just now: I shall be better very soon, and I
am not really disgusted with Strauss. I only fancy so
sometimes, as I do with all earthly things.</p>

<blockquote><p>In June Mrs. Bray writes to Miss Hennell that
Miss Evans "looks all the better of her London

but the two next letters show a relapse.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
end of
June,
(?) 1845.</div>

<p>Glad am I that some one can enjoy Strauss! The
million certainly will not, and I have ceased to sit
down to him with any relish. I should work much
better if I had some proof-sheets coming in to assure
me that my soul-stupefying labor is not in vain. I
am more grateful to you than I can tell you for taking
the trouble you do. If it had not been for your interest
and encouragement I should have been almost in
despair by this time.</p>

<blockquote><p>And again, a little later:</p></blockquote>

<p>I begin utterly to despair that Strauss will ever be
published, unless I can imitate the Rev. Mr. Davis,
and print it myself. At the very best, if we go on according
to the rate of procedure hitherto, the book will
not be published within the next two years. This
seems dolorous enough to me, whose only real satisfaction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
just now is some hope that I am not sowing
the wind. It is very laughable that I should be irritated
about a thing in itself so trifling as a translation,
but it is the very triviality of the thing that makes delays
provoking. The difficulties that attend a really
grand undertaking are to be borne, but things should
run smoothly and fast when they are not important
enough to demand the sacrifice of one's whole soul.
The second volume is quite ready. The last few sections
were written under anything but favorable circumstances.
They are not Strauss's best thoughts,
nor are they put into his translator's best language;
but I have not courage to imitate Gibbon&mdash;put my
work in the fire and begin again.</p>

<blockquote><p>In July, 1845, there seems to have arisen some
difficulty in getting in the cash subscriptions for the
publication. Mr. Charles Hennell and Mr. Joseph
Parkes, however, exerted themselves in the matter,
and £300 was collected, and the following letter
shows the relief it was to Miss Evans:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Charles
Hennell,
Friday
evening,
July, 1845.</div>

<p>Thank you for sending me the good news so soon,
and for sympathizing in my need of encouragement.
I have all I want now, and shall go forward on buoyant
wing. I am glad for the work's sake, glad for
your sake, and glad for "the honorable gentleman's"
sake, that matters have turned out so well. Pray
think no more of my pens, ink, and paper. I would
gladly give much more towards the work than these
and my English, if I could do so consistently with
duty.</p>

<blockquote><p>The book now got into the hands of the printers,
as will be seen from the next letter:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,

<p>I have just been looking over some of the <i>revise</i>, and
reading again your sweet letter to me from Hastings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and an impulse of gratitude and love will not let me
rest without writing you a little note, though my hand
has almost done its possible for the day under this
intense heat. You do not guess how much pleasure
it gives me to look over your pencillings, they prove
so clearly that you have really entered into the meaning
of every sentence, and it always gives one satisfaction
to see the evidence of brain-work. I am quite
indebted to you for your care, and I feel greatly the
advantage of having a friend to undertake the office
of critic. There is one word I must mention&mdash;Azazel
is the word put in the original of the Old Testament
for the scapegoat: now I imagine there is some dubiousness
about the meaning, and that Strauss would
not think it right to translate <em>scapegoat</em>, because, from
the tenor of his sentence, he appears to include Azazel
with the evil demons. I wonder if it be supposed by
any one that Azazel is in any way a distinct being from
the goat. I know no Hebrew scholar, and have access
to no Hebrew lexicon. Have you asked Mr. Hennell
about it?</p>

<p>Your letter describes what I <em>have</em> felt rather than
what I feel. It seems as if my affections were quietly
sinking down to temperate, and I every day seem
more and more to value thought rather than feeling.
I do not think this is man's best estate, but it is better
than what I have sometimes known.</p>

<p>I am not ashamed to confess that I should like to
be idle with you for a little while, more than anything
else I can think of just now. But, alas! leathery
brain must work at leathery Strauss for a short time
before my butterfly days come. O, how I shall
spread my wings then! Anent the Greek, it would
produce very dreadful cold perspirations indeed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
me, if there were anything amounting to a serious
error, but this, I trust, there will not be. You must
really expect me, if not to sleep and snore <i>aliquando</i>,
at least to nod in the course of some thousand pages.
I should like you to be deliberate over the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schluss
Abhandlung</i>. It is the only part on which I have bestowed
much pains, for the difficulty was <em>piquing</em>, not
piquant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I am never pained when I think Strauss right; but
in many cases I think him wrong, as every man must
be in working out into detail an idea which has general
truth, but is only one element in a perfect theory&mdash;not
a perfect theory in itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
25th Sept.

<p>I am delighted with the proof. The type and everything
else are just what I wished. To see the first
sheet is the next best thing to seeing the last, which I
hope we shall all have done this time next year.
There is a very misty vision of a trip to the Highlands
haunting us in this quarter. The vision would be
much pleasanter if Sara were one of the images in it.
You would surely go if we went, and then the thing
would be perfect. I long to see you, for you are becoming
a sort of transfigured existence, a mere ideal
to me, and I have nothing to tell me of your real flesh-and-blood
self but sundry very useful little pencil-marks,
and a scrap of Mrs. Bray's notes now and
then. So, if you would have me bear in my memory
your own self, and not some aerial creation that I call
by your name, you must make your appearance.</p>

<blockquote><p>In October "the misty vision" took palpable
shape, and the Brays, Miss Hennell, and Miss
Evans had a delightful fortnight in Scotland, visiting
Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine, The Trossachs,
Stirling, Edinburgh, Melrose, and Abbotsford.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
They were away from the 14th to the 28th,
and on returning to Coventry Strauss was taken
up again. Miss Hennell was reading the translation,
and aiding with suggestions and corrections.
The next letter to her seems to be dated in November.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

Hennell,

<p>Please to tell Mr. Hennell that "habits of thought"
is not a translation of the word <i>particularismus</i>. This
does not mean national idiosyncrasy, but is a word
which characterizes that idiosyncrasy. If he decidedly
objects to particularism, ask him to be so good as
substitute <i>exclusiveness</i>, though there is a shade of
meaning in <i>particularismus</i> which even that does not
express. It was because the word could only be
translated by a circumlocution that I ventured to Anglicize
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I have been idle, and have not done a stroke to the
prefaces, but they shall be sent as soon as possible.
Thanks for the copy of the Latin preface and letter.
They are in preconceived harmony with my ideas of
the appropriate.</p>

<p>I will leave the titlepage to you and Mr. Hennell.
Thanks for the news in your last <i>extra Blatt</i>. I am
glad to find that the theological organs are beginning
to deal with philosophy, but I can hardly imagine your
writer to be a friend with a false cognizance on his
shield. These dear orthodox people talk so simply
sometimes that one cannot help fancying them satirists
of their own doctrines and fears, though they mean
manfully to fight against the enemy. I should like if
possible to throw the emphasis on <em>critically</em> in the titlepage.
Strauss means it to be so: and yet I do not
know how we can put anything better than what you
say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I send you to-day the conclusion of the chapter you
are reading, and, unless you find anything of importance
to be rectified, you need not return this to me,
but may forward the whole to the printer as soon as
you have read it. I am not altogether satisfied with
the use of the word sacrament as applied specifically
to the <i>Abendmahl</i>. It seems like a vulgarism to say
<em>the</em> sacrament for one thing, and for another it does
not seem <em>ab</em>original enough in the life of Jesus; but I
know of no other word that can be substituted. I
have altered passover to paschal mealtho pascha, but <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">&#964;&#8056;
&#960;&#8049;&#963;&#967;&#945;</span> is
used in the New Testament of the eating of the lamb
<i>par excellence</i>. You remember, in the title of the first
section in the <i>Schluss</i>&mdash;which I had been so careless
as to omit&mdash;the expression is "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nothwendiger Uebergang
der Kritik in das Dogma.</span>" Now, dogmatism
will not do, as that would represent <i>Dogmatismus</i>.
"Dogmatik" is the idea, I believe&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, positive theology.
Is it allowable to say <i>dogmatics</i>, think you?
I do not understand how the want of manuscript can
be so pressing, as I have only had one proof for the
last fortnight. It seems quite dispiriting to me now
not to see the proofs regularly. I have had a miserable
week of headache, but am better now, and ready
for work, to which I must go.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I do pity you, with the drunken Christmas workmen
keeping you in this uncomfortable interregnum. But
do not go distraught; the spring will really come and
the birds&mdash;many having had to fly across the Atlantic,
which is farther than you have to go to establish yourself.
I could easily give the meaning of the Hebrew
word in question, as I know where to borrow a lexicon.
But observe, there are two Hebrew words untranslated
in this proof. I do not think it will do to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
give the English in one place and not in another,
where there is no reason for such a distinction, and
there is not here, for the note in this proof sounds just
as fee-fo-fum-ish as the other without any translation.
I could not alter the "troublesome," because it is the
nearest usable adjective for <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schwierig</i>, which stands in
the German. I am tired of inevitable <em>importants</em>, and
cannot bear to put them when they do not represent
the German.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I have been sadly occupied for the last ten days.
My father has been ill, and has required much attention,
and my own head was very middling for some
days, so that I send you but a poor cargo of new
manuscript. Indeed, on looking through the last
quire of paper this morning for the purpose of putting
in the Greek, it seemed all very poor to me, but the
subject is by no means inspiring, and no muse would
condescend to visit such an uncertain votary as I
have been for the last week or so. How is it that I
have only had one proof this week? You know we
are five hundred pages in advance of the printer, so
you need not be dreadfully alarmed. I have been so
pleased to hear some of your letters read to me, but,
alas! I can reflect no pleasure at this moment, for I
have a woful pain and am in a desperate hurry.</p>

<blockquote><p>On 14th February, 1846, Mrs. Bray writes to
Miss Sara Hennell that Miss Evans "says she is
Strauss-sick&mdash;it makes her ill dissecting the beautiful
story of the Crucifixion, and only the sight of
the Christ-image<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and picture make her endure it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Moreover, as her work advances nearer its public
appearance, she grows dreadfully nervous. Poor
thing, I do pity her sometimes, with her pale, sickly
face and dreadful headaches, and anxiety, too, about
her father. This illness of his has tried her so
much, for all the time she had for rest and fresh
air she had to read to him. Nevertheless, she
looks very happy and satisfied sometimes in her
work."</p>

<p>And about the end of February there is the following
letter from Miss Evans:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Health and greeting, my Achates, in this veritable
spring month. I shall send you a parcel on Monday
with sixty-four new pages of German for your intellectual
man. The next parcel, which will be the <span class="smcap">last</span>, I
shall send on the Monday following, and when you have
read to the end, you may, if you think it desirable, send
the whole to me. Your dull ass does not mend his
pace for beating; but he <em>does</em> mend it when he finds
out that he is near his journey's end, and makes you
wonder how he could pretend to find all the previous
drawing so hard for him. I plead guilty to having set
off in a regular scamper: but be lenient and do not
scold me if you find all sorts of carelessnesses in these
last hundred pages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I have been guilty of the most unpardonable piece
of carelessness, for which I am stretched on a rack of
anxiety and mortification. In the proof that came on
Thursday I unwittingly drew out a quarter sheet with
the blotting-paper, and did not discover the mistake
until Saturday morning, when about to correct the last
proof. Surely the printer would discover the absence
of the four pages and wait for them&mdash;otherwise I would
rather have lost one of my fingers, or all the hair from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
my head, than have committed such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux pas</i>. For
there were three very awkward blunders to be corrected.
All this vexation makes a cold and headache
doubly intolerable, and I am in a most purgatorial
state on this "good Sunday." I shall send the proofs,
with the unfortunate quarter sheet and an explanation,
to-night to Mr. Chapman, and prithee do thou inquire
and see that the right thing is done. The tears are
streaming from my smarting eyes&mdash;so farewell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I wish we could get the book out in May&mdash;why not?
I suppose the binding could not be all got through&mdash;the
printing and writing I should think might be managed
in time. Shouldn't I like to fleet the time away
with thee as they did in the Golden Age&mdash;after all our
toils to lie reclined on the hills (spiritually), like gods
together, careless of mankind. Sooth to speak, idleness,
and idleness with thee, is just the most tempting
mirage you could raise before my mind's eye&mdash;I say
mirage, because I am determined from henceforth to
believe in no substantiality for future time, but to live
in and love the present&mdash;of which I have done too little.
Still, the thought of being with you in your own

<p>The last hundred pages have certainly been totally
uninteresting to me, considered as matter for translation.
Strauss has inevitably anticipated in the earlier

part of his work all the principles and many of the details
of his criticism, and he seems fagged himself.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais courage!</i> the neck of the difficulty is broken, and
there is really very little to be done now. If one's
head would but keep in anything like thinking and
writing order! Mine has robbed me of half the last
fortnight; but I am a little better now, and am saying
to myself <i>Frisch zu!</i> The Crucifixion and the Resurrection
are, at all events, better than the bursting asunder
of Judas. I am afraid I have not made this dull
part of Strauss even as tolerable as it might be, for
both body and mind have recoiled from it. Thank
you, dearest, for all your love and patience for me and
with me. I have nothing on earth to complain of but
subjective maladies. Father is pretty well, and I have
not a single excuse for discontent through the livelong
day.</p>

<p>As I believe that even your kindness cannot overcome

and one that I would choose among a whole bouquet

and accept the good that the heavens and you offer

not at all like; but I thought you had corrected the

yours, so I determined to indulge my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</i> inclinations,
for I hate stickling and debating unless it be
for something really important. I do really like reading
our Strauss&mdash;he is so <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">klar und ideenvoll</i>; but I do
not know <em>one</em> person who is likely to read the book

she "is delighted beyond measure with Strauss's

<blockquote><p>The completion of the translation of Strauss is
another milestone passed in the life journey of
George Eliot, and the comparatively buoyant tone
of the letters immediately following makes us feel
that the galled neck is out of the yoke for a time.
In May, Mrs. Bray had gone away from home for a
visit, and the next letter is addressed to her.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do not stay any longer than is necessary to do you good,
lest I should lose the pleasure of loving you, for my
affections are always the warmest when my friends are
within an attainable distance. I think I can manage
to keep respectably warm towards you for three weeks
without seeing you, but I cannot promise more. Tell
Mr. Bray I am getting too amiable for this world, and
Mr. Donovan's wizard hand would detect a slight corrugation
of the skin on my organs 5 and
6;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
they are
so totally without exercise. I had a lecture from Mr.
Pears on Friday, as well as a sermon this morning, so
you need be in no alarm for my moral health. Do
you never think of those Caribs who, by dint of flattening
their foreheads, can manage to see perpendicularly
above them without so much as lifting their heads?
There are some good people who remind me of them.
They see everything so clearly and with so little trouble,
but at the price of sad self-mutilation.</p>

<blockquote><p>On the 26th May Miss Evans went to pay a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
visit to Mrs. and Miss Hennell at Hackney, and she
writes from there to Mrs. Bray, who was expected
to join them in London.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Bray,
end of
May, 1846.</div>

<p>I cannot deny that I am very happy without you, but
perhaps I shall be happier with you, so do not fail to
try the experiment. We have been to town only once,
and are saving all our strength to "rake" with you;
but we are as ignorant as Primitive Methodists about
any of the amusements that are going. Please to come
in a very mischievous, unconscientious, theatre-loving
humor. Everybody I see is very kind to me, and
therefore I think them all very charming; and, having
everything I want, I feel very humble and self-denying.
It is only rather too great a bore to have to write
to my friends when I am half asleep, and I have not
yet reached that pitch of amiability that makes such
magnanimity easy. Don't bring us any bad news
or any pains, but only nods and becks and wreathèd
smiles.</p>

<blockquote><p>They stayed in London till the 5th June, and on
the 15th of that month the translation of Strauss
was published. On the 2d July Mrs. Bray writes
to Miss Hennell that Miss Evans "is going to
Dover with her father, for a fortnight." In passing
through Dover on our way to the Continent,
in 1880, after our marriage, we visited the house they
stayed at in 1846, and my wife then told me that she
had suffered a great deal there, as her father's
health began to show signs of breaking up. On
returning to Coventry there is the following letter
referring to Wicksteed's review of the translation
of Strauss, which was advertised for the forthcoming
number of the <cite>Prospective Review</cite>.</p></blockquote>

for the sake of Wicksteed's review&mdash;is there anything
new in it? Do you know if Mr. Chapman has
any unusual facilities for obtaining cheap classics?
Such things are to be got handsome and second-hand
in London&mdash;if one knew but the way. I want to complete
Xenophon's works. I have the "Anabasis," and
I might, perhaps, get a nice edition of the "Memorabilia"
and "Cyropædia" in a cheaper way than by ordering
them directly from our own bookseller. I have
been reading the "Fawn of
Sertorius."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
I think you
would like it, though the many would not. It is pure,
chaste, and classic, beyond any attempt at fiction I
ever read. If it be Bulwer's, he has been undergoing
a gradual transfiguration, and is now ready to be exalted
into the assembly of the saints. The professor's
(Strauss's) letter, transmitted through you, gave me
infinite consolation, more especially the apt and pregnant
quotation from Berosus. Precious those little
hidden lakelets of knowledge in the high mountains,
far removed from the vulgar eye, only visited by the
soaring birds of love.</p>

<blockquote><p>On 25th September, 1846, Mrs. Bray writes to

<p>All the world is bathed in glory and beauty to me now,
and thou sharest in the radiance. Tell me whether I

which you know I have the minimum of endowment.
I am sinning against my daddy by yielding to the

me as if he wanted me to read to him.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I can get up any steam

Cara comes back, however, for she has run away with

come out?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>The review of Strauss contains some very just remarks,
though, on the whole, I think it shallow, and
in many cases unfair. The praise it gives to the
translation is just what I should have wished; indeed,
I cannot imagine anything more gratifying in the way
of laudation. Is it not droll that Wicksteed should
have chosen one of my interpolations, or rather paraphrases,
to dilate on. The expression "granite,"
applied to the sayings of Jesus, is nowhere used by
Strauss, but is an impudent addition of mine to eke
out his metaphor. Did you notice the review of Foster's
Life?<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
I am reading the Life, and thinking all
the time how you would like it. It is deeply interesting
to study the life of a genius under circumstances
amid which genius is so seldom to be found. Some of
the thoughts in his journal are perfect gems.</p>

<blockquote><p>The words of the reviewer of the Strauss translation
in the <cite>Prospective</cite> are worth preserving:
"A faithful, elegant, and scholarlike translation.
Whoever reads these volumes without any reference
to the German must be pleased with the easy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
perspicuous, idiomatic, and harmonious force of the
English style. But he will be still more satisfied
when, on turning to the original, he finds that the
rendering is word for word, thought for thought,
and sentence for sentence. In preparing so beautiful
a rendering as the present, the difficulties can
have been neither few nor small in the way of preserving,
in various parts of the work, the exactness
of the translation, combined with that uniform
harmony and clearness of style which imparts to
the volumes before us the air and spirit of an
original. Though the translator never obtrudes
himself upon the reader with any notes or comments
of his own, yet he is evidently a man who
has a familiar knowledge of the whole subject;
and if the work be the joint production of several
hands, moving in concert, the passages of a specially
scholastic character, at least, have received their
version from a discerning and well-informed theologian.
Indeed, Strauss may well say, as he does in
the notice which he writes for the English edition,
that, as far as he has examined it, the translation
is '<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et accurata et perspicua</span>.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Many things, both outward and inward, have concurred
to make this November far happier than the last.
One's thoughts</p>

<p class="center">
"Are widened with the process of the suns;"<br />
</p>

<p>and if one is rather doubtful whether one is really
wiser or better, it is some comfort to know that the
desire to be so is more pure and dominant. I have
been thinking of that most beautiful passage in Luke's
Gospel&mdash;the appearance of Jesus to the disciples at
Emmaus. How universal in its significance! The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
soul that has hopelessly followed its Jesus&mdash;its impersonation
of the highest and best&mdash;all in despondency;
its thoughts all refuted, its dreams all dissipated. Then
comes another Jesus&mdash;another, but the same&mdash;the
same highest and best, only chastened&mdash;crucified instead
of triumphant&mdash;and the soul learns that this is
the true way to conquest and glory. And then there
is the burning of the heart, which assures that "this
was the Lord!"&mdash;that this is the inspiration from above,
the true comforter that leads unto truth. But I am
not become a Methodist, dear Sara; on the contrary,
if I am pious one day, you may be sure I was very
wicked the day before, and shall be so again the next.</p>

<p>I have been at Griff for the last week, or I should
have written before. I thank you most heartily for
sending me "Heliados"&mdash;first, because I admire it
greatly in itself; and, secondly, because it is a pretty
proof that I am not dissociated from your most hallowed
thoughts. As yet I have read it only once, but I promise
myself to read it again and again. I shall not show
it to any one, for I hate "friendly criticism," as much
for you as for myself; but you have a better spirit
than I, and when you come I will render "Heliados"
up to you, that others may have the pleasure of reading
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Lying in bed this morning, grievously tormented,
your "Heliados" visited me and revealed itself to me
more completely than it had ever done before. How
true that "it is only when all portions of an individual
nature, or all members of society, move forward harmoniously
together that religious progress is calm and
beneficial!" I imagine the sorrowful amaze of a child
who had been dwelling with delight on the idea that
the stars were the pavement of heaven's court, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that there above them sat the kind but holy God, looking
like a venerable Father who would smile on his
good little ones&mdash;when it was cruelly told, before its
mind had substance enough to bear such tension,
that the sky was not real, that the stars were worlds,
and that even the sun could not be God's dwelling,
because there were many, many suns. These ideas
would introduce atheism into the child's mind, instead
of assisting it to form a nobler conception of God (of
course I am supposing the bare information given, and
left to the child to work upon); whereas the idea it
previously had of God was perfectly adapted to its intellectual
condition, and formed to the child as perfect
an embodiment of the all-good, all-wise, and all-powerful
as the most enlightened philosopher ever formed
to himself.</p>

<blockquote><p>On 21st April Miss Evans went to London with

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara

<p>I did so long to see you after hearing "Elijah," just to
exchange an exclamation of delight. Last night I had
a perfect treat, too, in "I Puritani." Castellar was admirable
as Elvira, and Gardoni as a seraph. N.B.&mdash;I

<blockquote><p>Mention has already been made of Miss Mary
Sibree (now Mrs. John Cash of Coventry), and as
the following genial letter is addressed to her, it
gives an opportunity for mentioning here that Miss
Evans had a high regard for all the members of
the Sibree family. At the end of this year (1847)
and the beginning of 1848 there will be found
an interesting correspondence with Miss Sibree's
brother, Mr. John Sibree, who, in 1849, published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a translation of Hegel's "Lectures on the Philosophy
of History," and in 1880 a volume of poems
entitled "Fancy, and other Rhymes." The subjoined
extract from a communication from Mrs.
Cash will show upon what terms Miss Evans was
with the family:</p>

<p>"It was in the early part of the year 1841 that
Miss Franklin came to see my mother at our house
on the Foleshill road&mdash;about a mile and a half
from Coventry&mdash;to tell her, as a piece of most interesting
news, that an old pupil, of whom she herself
and her sister Rebecca had always been very
proud, was coming at the Lady-Day quarter to live
at a house on the same road&mdash;within five minutes'
walk of ours. This was Miss Evans, then twenty-one
years of age. Miss Franklin dwelt with much
pride on Miss Evans's mental power, on her skill
in music, etc.; but the great recommendation to
my mother's interest was the zeal for others which
had marked her earnest piety at school, where she
had induced the girls to come together for prayer,
and which had led her to visit the poor most diligently
in the cottages round her own home. Many
years after, an old nurse of mine told me that
these poor people had said, after her removal, 'We
shall never have another Mary Ann Evans.'</p>

<p>"My mother was asked to second and help her
in work of this kind. 'She will be sure to get
something up very soon,' was the last remark I
can recall; and on her first visit to us I well remember
she told us of a club for clothing, set going
by herself and her neighbor Mrs. Pears, in a
district to which she said 'the euphonious name
of the Pudding-Pits had been given.' It was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
until the winter of 1841, or early in 1842, that my
mother first received (not from Miss Evans's own
lips, but through a mutual friend) the information
that a total change had taken place in this gifted
woman's mind with respect to the evangelical religion,
which she had evidently believed in up to the
time of her coming to Coventry, and for which, she
once told me, she had at one time sacrificed the
cultivation of her intellect, and a proper regard to
personal appearance. 'I used,' she said, 'to go
about like an owl, to the great disgust of my
brother; and I would have denied him what I now
see to have been quite lawful amusements.' My
mother's grief, on hearing of this change in one
whom she had begun to love, was very great; but
she thought argument and expostulation might do
much, and I well remember a long evening devoted
to it, but no more of the subject-matter than
her indignant refusal to blame the Jews for not
seeing in a merely spiritual Deliverer a fulfilment
of promises of a temporal one; and a still more
emphatic protest against my father's assertion that
we had no claim on God. To Miss Evans's affectionate
and pathetic speech to my mother, 'Now,
Mrs. Sibree, you won't care to have anything more
to do with me,' my mother rejoined, 'On the contrary,
I shall feel more interested in you than ever.'
But it was very evident at this time that she stood
in no <em>need</em> of sympathizing friends; that the desire
for congenial society, as well as for books and
larger opportunities for culture, which had led her
most eagerly to seek a removal from Griff to a
home near Coventry, had been met beyond her
highest expectations. In Mr. and Mrs. Bray, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in the Hennell family, she had found friends who
called forth her interest and stimulated her powers
in no common degree. This was traceable even in
externals&mdash;in the changed tone of voice and manner&mdash;from
formality to a geniality which opened
my heart to her, and made the next five years
the most important epoch in my life. She gave
me (as yet in my teens) weekly lessons in German,
speaking freely on all subjects, but with no attempt
to directly unsettle my evangelical beliefs, confining
herself in these matters to a steady protest
against the claim of the Evangelicals to an exclusive
possession of higher motives to morality&mdash;or
even to religion. Speaking to my mother of her
dearest friend, Mrs. Bray, she said, 'She is the
most religious person I know.' Of Mr. Charles
Hennell, in whose writings she had great interest,
she said, 'He is a perfect model of manly excellence.'</p>

<p>"On one occasion, at Mr. Bray's house at Rosehill,
roused by a remark of his on the beneficial
influence exercised by evangelical beliefs on the
moral feelings, she said energetically, 'I say it
now, and I say it once for all, that I am influenced
in my own conduct at the present time by
far higher considerations, and by a nobler idea of
duty, than I ever was while I held the evangelical
beliefs.' When, at length, after my brother's
year's residence at the Hallé University (in 1842-43),
my own mind having been much exercised in
the matter of religion, I felt the moral difficulties
press heavily on my conscience, and my whole
heart was necessarily poured out to my 'guide,
philosopher, and friend,' the steady turning of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
my attention from theoretical questions to a confession
of my own want of thoroughness in arithmetic,
which I pretended to teach; and the request
that I would specially give attention to this
study and get my conscience clear about it, and
that I would not come to her again until my views
of religion were also clear, is too characteristic of
Miss Evans, as I knew her during those years, and
too much in harmony with the moral teaching of
George Eliot, to be omitted in reminiscences by
one to whom that wholesome advice proved a turning-point
in life. Two things more I cannot omit
to mention: one, the heightened sense given to
me by her of the duty of making conversation
profitable, and, in general, of using time for serious
purposes&mdash;of the positive immorality of frittering
it away in ill-natured or in poor, profitless
talk; another, the debt (so frequently acknowledged
by Miss Evans to me) which she owed, during
the years of her life with her father, to the intercourse
she enjoyed with her friends at Rosehill.
Mr. and Mrs. Bray and Miss Hennell, with their
friends, were <em>her</em> world; and on my saying to her
once, as we closed the garden-door together, that
we seemed to be entering a paradise, she said, 'I
do indeed feel that I shut the world out when I
shut that door.' It is consoling to me now to feel
that in her terrible suffering through her father's
illness and death, which were most trying to witness,
she had such alleviations."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Mary
Sibree,
10th May,
1847.</div>

<p>It is worth while to forget a friend for a week or ten
days, just for the sake of the agreeable kind of startle
it gives one to be reminded that one has such a treasure
in reserve&mdash;the same sort of pleasure, I suppose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
that a poor body feels who happens to lay his hand on
an undreamed-of sixpence which had sunk to a corner
of his pocket. When Mr. Sibree brought me your parcel,
I had been to London for a week; and having
been full of Mendelssohn oratorios and Italian operas,
I had just this kind of delightful surprise when I saw
your note and the beautiful purse. Not that I mean
to compare you to a sixpence; you are a bright,
golden sovereign to me, with edges all unrubbed, fit
to remind a poor, tarnished, bruised piece, like me,
that there are ever fresh and more perfect coinages
of human nature forthcoming. I am very proud of my
purse&mdash;first, because I have long had to be ashamed
of drawing my old one out of my pocket; and, secondly,
because it is a sort of symbol of your love for
me&mdash;and who is not proud to be loved? For there is
a beautiful kind of pride at which no one need frown&mdash;I
may call it a sort of impersonal pride&mdash;a thrill of
exultation at all that is good and lovely and joyous as
a possession of our human nature.</p>

<p>I am glad to think of all your pleasure among
friends new and old. Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;'s mother is, I dare
say, a valuable person; but do not, I beseech thee, go
to old people as oracles on matters which date any
later than their thirty-fifth year. Only trust them, if
they are good, in those practical rules which are the
common property of long experience. If they are governed
by one special idea which circumstances or their
own mental bias have caused them to grasp with peculiar
firmness, and to work up into original forms,
make yourself master of their thoughts and convictions,
the residuum of all that long travail which poor
mortals have to encounter in their threescore years
and ten, but do not trust their application of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
gathered wisdom; for however just old people may be
their <em>principles</em> of judgment, they are often wrong
in their application of them, from an imperfect or unjust
conception of the matter to be judged. Love
and cherish and venerate the old; but never imagine
that a worn-out, dried-up organization can be so rich
in inspiration as one which is full fraught with life
and energy. I am not talking like one who is superlatively
jealous for the rights of the old; yet such I
am, I assure thee. I heard Mendelssohn's new oratorio,
"Elijah," when I was in London. It has been
performed four times in Exeter Hall to as large an
audience as the building would hold&mdash;Mendelssohn
himself the conductor. It is a glorious production,
and altogether I look upon it as a kind of sacramental
purification of Exeter Hall, and a proclamation of
indulgence for all that is to be perpetrated there during
this month of May. This is a piece of impiety
which you may expect from a lady who has been
guanoing her mind with French novels. This is the
impertinent expression of D'Israeli, who, writing himself
much more detestable stuff than ever came from
a French pen, can do nothing better to bamboozle the
unfortunates who are seduced into reading his "Tancred"
than speak superciliously of all other men and
things&mdash;an expedient much more successful in some
quarters than one would expect. But <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fond</i>, dear
Mary, I have no impiety in my mind at this moment,
and my soul heartily responds to your rejoicing that
society is attaining a more perfect idea and exhibition
of Paul's exhortation&mdash;"Let the same mind be in
you which was also in Christ Jesus." I believe the
Amen to this will be uttered more and more fervently,
"Among all posterities for evermore."

<p>I have read the "Inquiry" again with more than
interest&mdash;with delight and high admiration. My present
impression from it far surpasses the one I had
retained from my two readings about five years ago.
With the exception of a few expressions which seem
too little discriminating in the introductory sketch,
there is nothing in its whole tone, from beginning to
end, that jars on my moral sense; and apart from any
opinion of the book as an explanation of the existence
of Christianity and the Christian documents, I am sure
that no one, fit to read it at all, could read it without
being intellectually and morally stronger&mdash;the reasoning
is so close, the induction so clever, the style so
clear, vigorous, and pointed, and the animus so candid
and even generous. Mr. Hennell ought to be one of
the happiest of men that he has done such a life's
work. I am sure if I had written such a book I should
be invulnerable to all the arrows of all spiteful gods
and goddesses. I should say, "None of these things
move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself,"
seeing that I have delivered such a message of God to
men. The book is full of <em>wit</em>, to me. It gives me
that exquisite kind of laughter which comes from the
gratification of the reasoning faculties. For instance:
"If some of those who were actually at the mountain
doubted whether they saw Jesus or not, we may reasonably
doubt whether he was to be seen at all there:
especially as the words attributed to him do not seem
at all likely to have been said, from the disciples paying
no attention to them." "The disciples considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
her (Mary Magdalene's) words idle tales, and believed
them not." We have thus their example for considering
her testimony alone as insufficient, and for seeking
further evidence. To say "Jewish philosopher" seems
almost like saying a round square; yet those two words
appear to me the truest description of Jesus. I think
the "Inquiry" furnishes the utmost that can be done
towards obtaining a <em>real</em> view of the life and character
of Jesus, by rejecting as little as possible from the Gospels.
I confess that I should call many things "shining
ether," to which Mr. Hennell allows the solid angularity
of facts; but I think he has thoroughly worked
out the problem&mdash;subtract from the New Testament
the miraculous and highly improbable, and what will
be the remainder?</p>

<p>I heartily wish you had been with me to see all the
beauties which have gladdened my soul and made me
feel that this earth is as good a heaven as I ought to
dream of. I have a much greater respect for the Isle
of Wight, now I have seen it, than when I knew it only
by report&mdash;a compliment which one can seldom very
sincerely pay to things and people that one has heard
puffed and bepraised. I do long for you to see Alum
Bay. Fancy a very high precipice, the strata upheaved
perpendicularly in rainbow-like streaks of the brightest
maize, violet, pink, blue, red, brown, and brilliant white,
worn by the weather into fantastic fretwork, the deep
blue sky above, and the glorious sea below. It seems
an enchanted land, where the earth is of more delicate,
refined materials than this dingy planet of ours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
is wrought out of. You might fancy the strata formed
of the compressed pollen of flowers, or powder from
bright insects. You can think of nothing but Calypsos,
or Prosperos and Ariels, and such-like beings.</p>

<p>I find one very great spiritual good attendant on a
quiet, meditative journey among fresh scenes. I seem
to have removed to a distance from myself when I am
away from the petty circumstances that make up my
ordinary environment. I can take myself up by the
ears and inspect myself, like any other queer monster
on a small scale. I have had many thoughts, especially
on a subject that I should like to work out&mdash;"The
superiority of the consolations of philosophy to those
of (so-called) religion." Do you stare?</p>

<p>Thank you for putting me on reading Sir Charles
Grandison. I have read five volumes, and am only
vexed that I have not the two last on my table at this
moment, that I might have them for my <i>convives</i>. I
had no idea that Richardson was worth so much. I
have had more pleasure from him than from all the
Swedish novels together. The morality is perfect&mdash;there
is nothing for the new lights to correct.</p>

<p>How do you like "Lelia," of which you have never
spoken one word? I am provoked with you for being
in the least pleased with "Tancred;" but if you have
found out any lofty meaning in it, or any true picturing
of life, tell it me, and I will recant. I have found two
new readers of Strauss. One, a lady at Leamington,
who is also reading the "Inquiry," but likes Strauss
better! The other is a gentleman here in Coventry;
he says "it is most clever and ingenious, and that no
one whose faith rests only on the <em>common</em> foundation
can withstand it." I think he may safely say that his
faith rests on an <em>un</em>common foundation. The book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
will certainly give him a lift in the right direction, from
its critical, logical character&mdash;just the opposite of his
own. I was interested the other day in talking to a
young lady who lives in a nest of clergymen, her brothers,
but not of the evangelical school. She had been
reading Blanco White's life, and seems to have had
her spirit stirred within her, as every one's must be
who reads the book with any power of appreciation.
She is unable to account to herself for the results at
which Blanco White arrived with his earnestness and
love of truth; and she asked me if I had come to the
same conclusions.</p>

<p>I think "Live and teach" should be a proverb as
well as "Live and learn." We must teach either for
good or evil; and if we use our inward light as the
Quaker tells us, always taking care to feed and trim it
well, our teaching must, in the end, be for good. We
are growing old together&mdash;are we not? I am growing
happier too. I am amusing myself with thinking of
the prophecy of Daniel as a sort of allegory. All those
monstrous, "rombustical" beasts with their horns&mdash;the
horn with eyes and a mouth speaking proud things,
and the little horn that waxed rebellious and stamped
on the stars, seem like my passions and vain fancies,
which are to be knocked down one after the other,
until all is subdued into a universal kingdom over
which the Ancient of Days presides&mdash;the spirit of love&mdash;the
Catholicism of the Universe&mdash;if you can attach
any meaning to such a phrase. It <em>has</em> a meaning for
my sage noddle.</p>

<p>I am reading George Sand's "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres d'un Voyageur</span>"
with great delight, and hoping that they will
some time do you as much good as they do me. In
the meantime, I think the short letter about "Lelia"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
will interest you. It has a very deep meaning to my
apprehension. You can send back the pages when
you have duly digested them. I once said of you that
yours was a sort of alkali nature which would detect
the slightest acid of falsehood. You began to phiz-z-z
directly it approached you. I want you as a test. I
now begin to see the necessity of the arrangement (a

to before, with Mr. John Sibree:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
J. Sibree,

<p>Begin your letter by abusing me, according to my example.
There is nothing like a little gunpowder for
a damp chimney; and an explosion of that sort will set
the fire of your ideas burning to admiration. I hate
bashfulness and modesties, as Sir Hugh Evans would
say; and I warn you that I shall make no apologies,
though, from my habit of writing only to people who,
rather than have nothing from me, will tolerate nothings,
I shall be very apt to forget that you are not one
of those amiably silly individuals. I must write to
you <i>more meo</i>, without taking pains or laboring to be
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spirituelle</i> when Heaven never meant me to be so; and
it is your own fault if you bear with my letters a moment
after they become an infliction. I am glad you
detest Mrs. Hannah More's letters. I like neither her
letters, nor her books, nor her character. She was
that most disagreeable of all monsters, a blue-stocking&mdash;a
monster that can only exist in a miserably
false state of society, in which a woman with but a
smattering of learning or philosophy is classed along
with singing mice and card-playing pigs. It is some
time since I read "Tancred," so that I have no very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
vivid recollection of its details; but I thought it very
"thin," and inferior in the working up to "Coningsby"
and "Sybil." Young Englandism is almost as remote
from my sympathies as Jacobitism, as far as its force
is concerned, though I love and respect it as an effort
on behalf of the people. D'Israeli is unquestionably
an able man, and I always enjoy his tirades against
liberal principles as opposed to popular principles&mdash;the
name by which he distinguishes his own. As to
his theory of races, it has not a leg to stand on, and
can only be buoyed up by such windy eloquence as&mdash;You
chubby-faced, squabby-nosed Europeans owe your
commerce, your arts, your religion, to the Hebrews&mdash;nay,
the Hebrews lead your armies: in proof of which
he can tell us that Massena, a second-rate general of
Napoleon's, was a Jew, whose real name was Manasseh.
Extermination up to a certain point seems to be the
law for the inferior races&mdash;for the rest fusion, both for
physical and moral ends. It appears to me that the
law by which privileged classes degenerate, from continual
intermarriage, must act on a larger scale in deteriorating
whole races. The nations have been always
kept apart until they have sufficiently developed
their idiosyncrasies, and then some great revolutionary
force has been called into action, by which the genius
of a particular nation becomes a portion of the common
mind of humanity. Looking at the matter æsthetically,
our idea of beauty is never formed on the characteristics
of a single race. I confess the types of the
pure races, however handsome, always impress me disagreeably;
there is an undefined feeling that I am
looking not at <em>man</em>, but at a specimen of an order under
Cuvier's class Bimana. The negroes certainly
puzzle me. All the other races seem plainly destined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to extermination, not excepting even the Hebrew Caucasian.
But the negroes are too important, physiologically
and geographically, for one to think of their
extermination; while the repulsion between them and
the other races seems too strong for fusion to take
place to any great extent. On one point I heartily
agree with D'Israeli as to the superiority of the Oriental
races&mdash;their clothes are beautiful and their manners
are agreeable. Did you not think the picture of the
Barroni family interesting? I should like to know
who are the originals. The fellowship of race, to
which D'Israeli so exultingly refers the munificence
of Sidonia, is so evidently an inferior impulse, which
must ultimately be superseded, that I wonder even he,
Jew as he is, dares to boast of it. My Gentile nature
kicks most resolutely against any assumption of superiority
in the Jews, and is almost ready to echo Voltaire's
vituperation. I bow to the supremacy of Hebrew
poetry, but much of their early mythology, and
almost all their history, is utterly revolting. Their
stock has produced a Moses and a Jesus; but Moses
was impregnated with Egyptian philosophy, and Jesus
is venerated and adored by us only for that wherein
he transcended or resisted Judaism. The very exaltation
of their idea of a national deity into a spiritual
monotheism seems to have been borrowed from the
other Oriental tribes. Everything specifically Jewish
is of a low grade.</p>

<p>And do you really think that sculpture and painting
are to die out of the world? If that be so, let another
deluge come as quickly as possible, that a new race of
Glums and Gowries may take possession of this melancholy
earth. I agree with you as to the inherent superiority
of music&mdash;as that questionable woman, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Countess Hahn-Hahn, says painting and sculpture are
but an idealizing of our actual existence. Music
arches over this existence with another and a diviner.
Amen, too, to that <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ideenvoll</i> observation of Hegel's.
"We hardly know what it is to feel for human misery
until we have heard a shriek; and a more perfect hell
might be made out of sound than out of any preparation
of fire and brimstone." When the tones of our
voice have betrayed peevishness or harshness, we
seem to be doubly haunted by the ghost of our sin; we
are doubly conscious that we have been untrue to our
part in the great Handel chorus. But I cannot assent
to the notion that music is to supersede the other arts,
or that the highest minds must necessarily aspire to a
sort of Milton blindness, in which the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">tiefste der Sinne</i>
is to be a substitute for all the rest. I cannot recognize
the truth of all that is said about the necessity of religious
fervor to high art. I am sceptical as to the
real existence of such fervor in any of the greatest
artists. Artistic power seems to me to resemble dramatic
power&mdash;to be an intimate perception of the
varied states of which the human mind is susceptible,
with ability to give them out anew in intensified expression.
It is true that the older the world gets
originality becomes less possible. Great subjects are
used up, and civilization tends evermore to repress individual
predominance, highly wrought agony, or ecstatic
joy. But all the gentler emotions will be ever
new, ever wrought up into more and more lovely combinations,
and genius will probably take their direction.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a head of Christ taken from a
statue, by Thorwaldsen, of Christ scourged? If not, I
think it would almost satisfy you. There is another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
work of his, said to be very sublime, of the Archangel
waiting for the command to sound the last trumpet.
Yet Thorwaldsen came at the fag end of time.</p>

<p>I am afraid you despise landscape painting; but to
me even the works of our own Stanfield, and Roberts,
and Creswick bring a whole world of thought and bliss&mdash;"a
sense of something far more deeply interfused."
The ocean and the sky and the everlasting hills are
spirit to me, and they will never be robbed of their
sublimity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
J. Sibree,

<p>I have tired myself with trying to write cleverly, <i>invitâ
Minervâ</i>, and having in vain endeavored to refresh
myself by turning over Lavater's queer sketches of
physiognomies, and still queerer judgments on them,
it is a happy thought of mine that I have a virtuous
reason for spending my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> on you.</p>

<p>I send you a stanza I picked up the other day in
George Sand's "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres d'un Voyageur</span>," which is almost
the ultimatum of human wisdom on the question
of human sorrow.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<span class="i0">"Le bonheur et le malheur,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Le bonheur nous rend heureux,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et le malheur malheureux,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voilà la différence."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ah, here comes a cup of coffee to console me! When
I have taken it I will tell you what George Sand says:
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sais tu bien que tout est dit devant Dieu et devant
les hommes quand l'homme infortuné demande compte
de ses maux et qu'il obtient cette réponse? Qu'y a-t-il
de plus? Rien.</span>" But I am not a mocking pen, and
if I were talking to you instead of writing, you would
detect some falsity in the ring of my voice. Alas!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the atrabiliar patient you describe is first cousin to me
in my very worst moods, but I have a profound faith
that the serpent's head will be bruised. This conscious
kind of false life that is ever and anon endeavoring
to form itself within us and eat away our true life,
will be overcome by continued accession of vitality, by
our perpetual increase in "quantity of existence," as
Foster calls it. Creation is the superadded life of the
intellect; sympathy, all-embracing love, the superadded
moral life. These given more and more abundantly,
I feel that all the demons, which are but my own egotism
mopping and mowing and gibbering, would vanish
away, and there would be no place for them,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For every gift of noble origin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is breathed upon by hope's perpetual breath."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Evils, even sorrows, are they not all negations? Thus
matter is in a perpetual state of decomposition; superadd
the principle of life, and the tendency to decomposition
is overcome. Add to this consciousness, and
there is a power of self-amelioration. The passions
and senses decompose, so to speak. The intellect, by
its analytic power, restrains the fury with which they
rush to their own destruction; the moral nature purifies,
beautifies, and at length transmutes them. But
to whom am I talking? You know far more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur ce
chapitre</i> than I.</p>

<p>Every one talks of himself or herself to me, and I beg
you will follow every one's example in this one thing
only. Individuals are precious to me in proportion as
they unfold to me their intimate selves. I have just
had lent me the journal of a person who died some
years ago. When I was less venerable I should have
felt the reading of such a thing insupportable; now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
it interests me, though it is the simplest record of
events and feelings.</p>

<p>Mary says she has told you about Mr. Dawson and
his lecture&mdash;miserably crude and mystifying in some
parts, but with a few fine passages. He is a very delightful
man, but not (at least so say my impressions)
a great man. How difficult it is to be great in this
world, where there is a tariff for spiritualities as well as
for beeves and cheese and tallow. It is scarcely possible
for a man simply to give out his true inspiration&mdash;the
real, profound conviction which he has won by
hard wrestling, or the few-and-far-between pearls of
imagination; he must go on talking or writing by rote,
or he must starve. Would it not be better to take
to tent-making with Paul, or to spectacle-making with
Spinoza?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
J. Sibree,
Feb 1848.</div>

<p>Write and tell you that I join you in your happiness
about the French Revolution? Very fine, my good
friend. If I made you wait for a letter as long as you
do me, our little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">échantillon</i> of a millennium would be
over, Satan would be let loose again, and I should have
to share your humiliation instead of your triumph.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I absolve you, for the sole merit of
thinking rightly (that is, of course, just as I do) about <i>la
grande nation</i> and its doings. You and Carlyle (have
you seen his article in last week's <cite>Examiner</cite>?) are
the only two people who feel just as I would have
them&mdash;who can glory in what is actually great and
beautiful without putting forth any cold reservations
and incredulities to save their credit for wisdom. I
am all the more delighted with your enthusiasm because
I didn't expect it. I feared that you lacked revolutionary
ardor. But no&mdash;you are just as <i>sans-culottish</i> and
rash as I would have you. You are not one of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
sages whose reason keeps so tight a rein on their emotions
that they are too constantly occupied in calculating
consequences to rejoice in any great manifestation
of the forces that underlie our every-day existence. I
should have written a soprano to your jubilate the
very next day, but that, lest I should be exalted above
measure, a messenger of Satan was sent in the form
of a headache, and directly on the back of that a face-ache,
so that I have been a mere victim of sensations,
memories, and visions for the last week. I am even
now, as you may imagine, in a very shattered, limbo-like
mental condition.</p>

<p>I thought we had fallen on such evil days that we
were to see no really great movement; that ours was
what St. Simon calls a purely critical epoch, not at all
an organic one; but I begin to be glad of my date. I
would consent, however, to have a year clipped off my
life for the sake of witnessing such a scene as that of the
men of the barricades bowing to the image of Christ,
"who first taught fraternity to men." One trembles to
look into every fresh newspaper lest there should be
something to mar the picture; but hitherto even the
scoffing newspaper critics have been compelled into a
tone of genuine respect for the French people and the
Provisional Government. Lamartine can act a poem
if he cannot write one of the very first order. I hope
that beautiful face given to him in the pictorial newspaper
is really his; it is worthy of an aureole. I am
chiefly anxious about Albert, the operative, but his picture
is not to be seen. I have little patience with people
who can find time to pity Louis Philippe and his
moustachioed sons. Certainly our decayed monarchs
should be pensioned off; we should have a hospital for
them, or a sort of zoological garden, where these worn-out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
humbugs may be preserved. It is but justice that
we should keep them, since we have spoiled them for
any honest trade. Let them sit on soft cushions, and
have their dinner regularly, but, for Heaven's sake, preserve
me from sentimentalizing over a pampered old
man when the earth has its millions of unfed souls and
bodies. Surely he is not so Ahab-like as to wish that
the revolution had been deferred till his son's days:
and I think that the shades of the Stuarts would have
some reason to complain if the Bourbons, who are so
little better than they, had been allowed to reign much
longer.</p>

<p>I should have no hope of good from any imitative
movement at home. Our working classes are eminently
inferior to the mass of the French people. In
France the <em>mind</em> of the people is highly electrified;
they are full of ideas on social subjects; they really
desire social <em>reform</em>&mdash;not merely an acting out of
Sancho Panza's favorite proverb, "Yesterday for you,
to-day for me." The revolutionary animus extended
over the whole nation, and embraced the rural population&mdash;not
merely, as with us, the artisans of the towns.
Here there is so much larger a proportion of selfish
radicalism and unsatisfied brute sensuality (in the agricultural
and mining districts especially) than of perception
or desire of justice that a revolutionary movement
would be simply destructive, not constructive.
Besides, it would be put down. Our military have no
notion of "fraternizing." They have the same sort of inveteracy
as dogs have for the ill-dressed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</i>. They
are as mere a brute force as a battering-ram; and the
aristocracy have got firm hold of them. And there is
nothing in our constitution to obstruct the slow progress
of <em>political</em> reform. This is all we are fit for at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
present. The social reform which may prepare us for
great changes is more and more the object of effort
both in Parliament and out of it. But we English are
slow crawlers. The sympathy in Ireland seems at
present only of the water-toast kind. The Glasgow
riots are more serious; but one cannot believe in a
Scotch Reign of Terror in these days. I should not
be sorry to hear that the Italians had risen <i>en masse</i>,
and chased the odious Austrians out of beautiful Lombardy.
But this they could hardly do without help,
and that involves another European war.</p>

<p>Concerning the "tent-making," there is much more
to be said, but am I to adopt your rule and never speak
of what I suppose we agree about? It is necessary to
me, not simply to <em>be</em> but to <em>utter</em>, and I require utterance
of my friends. What is it to me that I think the
same thoughts? I think them in a somewhat different
fashion. No mind that has any <em>real</em> life is a mere echo
of another. If the perfect unison comes occasionally,
as in music, it enhances the harmonies. It is like a
diffusion or expansion of one's own life to be assured
that its vibrations are repeated in another, and words
are the media of those vibrations. Is not the universe
itself a perpetual utterance of the one Being? So I
say again, utter, utter, utter, and it will be a deed of
mercy twice blessed, for I shall be a safety-valve for your
communicativeness and prevent it from splitting honest
people's brains who don't understand you; and,
moreover, it will be fraught with ghostly comfort to me.</p>

my hearty and not inexperienced sympathy; for, to

genus as yours, though rather differing in species. I
sincerely rejoice in the step you have taken; it is an
absolutely necessary condition for any true development
of your nature. It was impossible to think of
your career with hope, while you tacitly subscribed to
the miserable <i>etiquette</i> (it deserves no better or more

true, firm, and loving; not too anxious about immediate
usefulness to others&mdash;that can only be a result of
justice to yourself. Study mental hygiene. Take long
doses of <i>dolce far niente</i>, and be in no great hurry about

from morning callers, dinners, and decencies, and

<p>In my view there are but two kinds of <em>regular</em> correspondence
possible&mdash;one of simple affection, which
gives a picture of all the details, painful and pleasurable,
that a loving heart pines after, and this we carry
on through the medium of Cara; or one purely moral
and intellectual, carried on for the sake of ghostly edification,
in which each party has to put salt on the
tails of all sorts of ideas on all sorts of subjects, in
order to send a weekly or fortnightly packet, as so
much duty and self-castigation. I have always been
given to understand that such Lady-Jane-Grey-like
works were your abhorrence. However, let me know
what you <em>would</em> like&mdash;what would make you continue
to hold me in loving remembrance or convince you that
you are a bright evergreen in my garden of pleasant
plants. Behold me ready to tear off my right hand or
pluck out my right eye (metaphorically, of course&mdash;I
speak to an experienced exegetist, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme dirait notre</i>
Strauss), or write reams of letters full of interesting
falsehoods or very dull truths. We have always concluded
that our correspondence should be of the <em>third</em>
possible kind&mdash;one of impulse, which is necessarily irregular
as the Northern Lights.</p>

<p>I am a miserable wretch, with aching limbs and
sinking spirits, but still alive enough to feel the kindness
of your last note. I thoroughly enjoyed your
delight in Emerson. I should have liked to see you
sitting by him "with awful eye," for once in your life
feeling all the bliss of veneration. I am quite uncertain
about our movements. Dear father gets on very
slowly, if at all. You will understand the impossibility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of my forming any plans for my own pleasure. Rest
is the only thing I can think of with pleasure now.</p>

<p>Dear father is so decidedly progressing towards recovery
that I am full of quiet joy&mdash;a gentle dawning
light after the moonlight of sorrow. I have found already
some of the "sweet uses" that belong only to
what is called trouble, which is, after all, only a deepened
gaze into life, like the sight of the darker blue and
the thickening host of stars when the hazy effect of twilight
is gone&mdash;as our dear Blanco White said of death.
I shall have less time than I have had at my own disposal,
probably; but I feel prepared to accept life, nay,
lovingly to embrace it, in any form in which it shall present
itself.</p>

<p>Your words of affection seem to make this earthly atmosphere
sit less heavily on my shoulders, and in gratitude
I must send you my thanks before I begin to
read of Henry Gow and Fair Catharine for father's delectation.
In truth, I have found it somewhat difficult
to live for the last week&mdash;conscious all the time that
the only additions to my lot worth having must be
more strength to love in my own nature; but perhaps
this very consciousness has an irritating rather than
a soothing effect. I have a fit of sensitiveness upon
me, which, after all, is but egotism and mental idleness.
The enthusiasm without which one cannot even pour
out breakfast well (at least <em>I</em> cannot) has forsaken me.
You may laugh, and wonder when my enthusiasm has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
displayed itself, but that will only prove that you are
no seer. I can never live long without it in some form
or other. I possess my soul in patience for a time, believing
that this dark, damp vault in which I am groping
will soon come to an end, and the fresh, green earth
and the bright sky be all the more precious to me.
But for the present my address is Grief Castle, on the
River of Gloom, in the Valley of Dolor. I was amused
to find that Castle Campbell in Scotland was called so.
Truly for many seasons in my life I should have been
an appropriate denizen of such a place; but I have
faith that unless I am destined to insanity, I shall never
again abide long in that same castle. I heartily
say Amen to your dictum about the cheerfulness of
"large moral regions." Where <em>thought</em> and <em>love</em> are
active&mdash;thought the formative power, love the vitalizing&mdash;there
can be no sadness. They are in themselves a
more intense and extended participation of a divine
existence. As they grow, the highest species of faith
grows too, and all things are possible. I don't know
why I should prose in this way to you. But I wanted
to thank you for your note, and all this selfish grumbling
was at my pen's end. And now I have no time
to redeem myself. We shall not stay long away from
home, I feel sure.</p>

<p>Father has done wonders in the way of walking and

to amuse himself, so that I scarcely feel easy in

you everything now, except that I look amiable in spite
of a strong tendency to look black, and speak gently,
though with a strong propensity to be snappish. Pity

<p>Alas for the fate of poor mortals, which condemns
them to wake up some fine morning and find all the
poetry in which their world was bathed only the evening
before utterly gone!&mdash;the hard, angular world of
chairs and tables and looking-glasses staring at them
in all its naked prose! It is so in all the stages of
life; the poetry of girlhood goes, the poetry of love and
marriage, the poetry of maternity, and at last the very
poetry of duty forsakes us for a season, and we see ourselves,
and all about us, as nothing more than miserable
agglomerations of atoms&mdash;poor tentative efforts of
the <i>Natur Princip</i> to mould a personality. This is the
state of prostration, the self-abnegation, through which
the soul must go, and to which perhaps it must again
and again return, that its poetry or religion, which is
the same thing, may be a real, ever-flowing river, fresh
from the windows of heaven and the fountains of the
great deep&mdash;not an artificial basin, with grotto-work
and gold-fish. I feel a sort of madness growing upon
me, just the opposite of the delirium which makes
people fancy that their bodies are filling the room. It
seems to me as if I were shrinking into that mathematical
abstraction, a point. But I am wasting this
"good Sunday morning" in grumblings.</p>

<p>Poor Louis Blanc! The newspapers make me melancholy;

the memory of every man and woman who has had a
deep <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ahnung</i>&mdash;a presentiment, a yearning, or a clear
vision&mdash;of the time when this miserable reign of Mammon
shall end; when men shall be no longer "like the
fishes of the sea," society no more like a face one half
of which&mdash;the side of profession, of lip-faith&mdash;is fair and

God-like; the other half&mdash;the side of deeds and institutions&mdash;with
a hard, old, wrinkled skin puckered into the
sneer of a Mephistopheles. I worship the man who
has written as the climax of his appeal against society,
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'inegalité des talents <i>doit aboutir</i> non à l'inegalité

will wonder what has wrought me up into this fury. It
is the loathsome fawning, the transparent hypocrisy,
the systematic giving as little as possible for as much
as possible that one meets with here at every turn. I
feel that society is training men and women for hell.</p>

<p>All creatures about to moult, or to cast off an old
skin, or enter on any new metamorphosis, have sickly
feelings. It was so with me. But now I am set free
from the irritating, worn-out integument. I am entering
on a new period of my life, which makes me look
back on the past as something incredibly poor and
contemptible. I am enjoying repose, strength, and
ardor in a greater degree than I have ever known,
and yet I never felt my own insignificance and imperfection
so completely. My heart bleeds for dear father's
pains, but it is blessed to be at hand to give the
soothing word and act needed. I should not have
written this description of myself but that I felt your
affectionate letter demanded some I-ism, which, after
all, is often humility rather than pride. Paris, poor

<p>I have read "Jane Eyre," and shall be glad to know
what you admire in it. All self-sacrifice is good, but
one would like it to be in a somewhat nobler cause
than that of a diabolical law which chains a man soul

little less like the heroes and heroines of police reports.

<p>I have seen Emerson&mdash;the first <em>man</em> I have ever seen.
But you have seen still more of him, so I need not tell
you what he is. I shall leave Cara to tell how the day&mdash;the
Emerson day&mdash;was spent, for I have a swimming
head from hanging over the desk to write business letters
for father. Have you seen the review of Strauss's
pamphlet in the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>? The title is "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Romantiker
auf dem Throne der Cäsaren, oder Julian
der Abtrünnige</span>"&mdash;a sort of erudite satire on the King
of Prussia; but the reviewer pronounces it to have a
permanent value quite apart from this fugitive interest.
The "Romantiker," or Romanticist, is one who, in literature,
in the arts, in religion or politics, endeavors
to revive the dead past. Julian was a romanticist in
wishing to restore the Greek religion and its spirit,
when mankind had entered on the new development.
But you have very likely seen the review. I must copy
one passage, translated from the conclusion of Strauss's
pamphlet, lest you should not have met with it.
"Christian writers have disfigured the death-scene of
Julian. They have represented him as furious, blaspheming,
despairing, and in his despair exclaiming,
<em>Thou</em> hast conquered, O
Galilean!&mdash;'<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">&#957;&#949;&#957;&#8055;&#954;&#951;&#954;&#945;&#962;
&#915;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#8150;&#949;</span>.'
This phrase, though false as history, has a truth in it.
It contains a prophecy&mdash;to us a consoling prophecy&mdash;and
it is this: Every Julian&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, every great and powerful
man&mdash;who would attempt to resuscitate a state of
society which has died, will infallibly be vanquished by
the Galilean&mdash;for the Galilean is nothing less than the
genius of the future!"

<p>Father's tongue has just given utterance to a thought
which has been very visibly radiating from his eager
eyes for some minutes. "I thought you were going
on with the book." I can only bless you for those

of stupidity and barrenness, with a yawning trapdoor
ready to let me down into utter fatuity. But I
can even yet feel the omnipotence of a glorious chord.

the intellect and the passions which have scattered

<p>I have been holding a court of conscience, and I cannot
enjoy my Sunday's music without restoring harmony,
without entering a protest against that superficial
soul of mine which is perpetually contradicting
and belying the true inner soul. I am in that mood
which, in another age of the world, would have led me
to put on sackcloth and pour ashes on my head, when
I call to mind the sins of my tongue&mdash;my animadversions
on the faults of others, as if I thought myself to
be something when I am nothing. When shall I attain
to the true spirit of love which Paul has taught
for all the ages? I want no one to excuse me, dear
Fanny; I only want to remove the shadow of my miserable
words and deeds from before the divine image
of truth and goodness, which I would have all beings
worship. I need the Jesuits' discipline of silence, and
though my "evil speaking" issues from the intellectual
point of view rather than the moral&mdash;though there may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
be gall in the thought while there is honey in the feeling,
yet the evil speaking is wrong. We may satirize
character and qualities in the abstract without injury
to our moral nature, but persons hardly ever. Poor
hints and sketches of souls as we are&mdash;with some
slight, transient vision of the perfect and the true&mdash;we
had need help each other to gaze at the blessed

find out the motes there.</p>

until this morning, when, father being better, I was determined
to play a mass before the piano is utterly out

true disciple of Jesus. I am still feeling rather shattered
in brain and limbs; but do not suppose that I
lack inward peace and strength. My body is the defaulter&mdash;<em>consciously</em>
so. I triumph over all things in
the spirit, but the flesh is weak, and disgraces itself
by headaches and backaches. I am delighted to find
that you mention Macaulay, because that is an indication
that Mr. Hennell has been reading him. I
thought of Mr. H. all through the book, as the only
person I could be quite sure would enjoy it as
much as I did myself. I did not know if it would
interest you: tell me more explicitly that it does.

<p>My life is a perpetual nightmare, and always haunted
by something to be done, which I have never the
time, or, rather, the energy, to do. Opportunity is
kind, but only to the industrious, and I, alas! am not
one of them. I have sat down in desperation this
evening, though dear father is very uneasy, and his
moans distract me, just to tell you that you have full
absolution for your criticism, which I do not reckon
of the impertinent order. I wish you thoroughly to
understand that the writers who have most profoundly
influenced me&mdash;who have rolled away the waters from
their bed, raised new mountains and spread delicious
valleys for me&mdash;are not in the least oracles to me. It
is just possible that I may not embrace one of their
opinions; that I may wish my life to be shaped quite
differently from theirs. For instance, it would signify
nothing to me if a very wise person were to stun me
with proofs that Rousseau's views of life, religion, and
government are miserably erroneous&mdash;that he was guilty
of some of the worst <i>bassesses</i> that have degraded
civilized man. I might admit all this: and it would
be not the less true that Rousseau's genius has sent
that electric thrill through my intellectual and moral
frame which has awakened me to new perceptions;
which has made man and nature a fresh world of
thought and feeling to me; and this not by teaching
me any new belief. It is simply that the rushing
mighty wind of his inspiration has so quickened my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
faculties that I have been able to shape more definitely
for myself ideas which had previously dwelt as
dim <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ahnungen</i> in my soul; the fire of his genius has
so fused together old thoughts and prejudices that I
have been ready to make new combinations.</p>

<p>It is thus with George Sand. I should never dream
of going to her writings as a moral code or text-book.
I don't care whether I agree with her about marriage
or not&mdash;whether I think the design of her plot correct,
or that she had no precise design at all, but began to
write as the spirit moved her, and trusted to Providence
for the catastrophe, which I think the more
probable case. It is sufficient for me, as a reason for
bowing before her in eternal gratitude to that "great
power of God manifested in her," that I cannot read
six pages of hers without feeling that it is given to her
to delineate human passion and its results, and (I must
say, in spite of your judgment) some of the moral instincts
and their tendencies, with such truthfulness,
such nicety of discrimination, such tragic power, and,
withal, such loving, gentle humor, that one might live
a century with nothing but one's own dull faculties,
and not know so much as those six pages will suggest.
The psychological anatomy of Jacques and Fernande
in the early days of their marriage seems quite preternaturally
true&mdash;I mean that her power of describing it
is preternatural. Fernande and Jacques are merely
the feminine and the masculine nature, and their early
married life an every-day tragedy; but I will not dilate
on the book or on your criticism, for I am so sleepy
that I should write nothing but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bêtises</i>. I have at last
the most delightful "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De imitatione Christi</span>," with quaint
woodcuts. One breathes a cool air as of cloisters in
the book&mdash;it makes one long to be a saint for a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
months. Verily its piety has its foundations in the
depth of the divine-human soul.</p>

<blockquote><p>In March Miss Evans wrote a short notice of the
"Nemesis of Faith" for the <cite>Coventry Herald</cite>, in
which she says:</p></blockquote>

<p>"We are sure that its author is a bright, particular
star, though he sometimes leaves us in doubt whether
he be not a fallen 'son of the morning.'"</p>

<blockquote><p>The paper was sent to Mr. Froude, and on 23d
March Mrs. Bray writes to Miss Hennell: "Last
night at dusk M. A. came running in in high glee
with a most charming note from Froude, naïvely
and prettily requesting her to reveal herself. He
says he recognized her hand in the review in the
<cite>Coventry Herald</cite>, and if she thinks him a fallen
star she might help him to rise, but he 'believes
he has only been dipped in the Styx, and is not
much the worse for the bath.' Poor girl, I am so
pleased she should have this little episode in her
dull life."</p>

<p>Tell me not that I am a mere prater&mdash;that feeling
never talks. I will talk, and caress, and look lovingly,
until death makes me as stony as the Gorgon-like
heads of all the judicious people I know. What
is anything worth until it is uttered? Is not the universe
one great utterance? Utterance there must be
in word or deed to make life of any worth. Every true
pentecost is a gift of utterance. Life is too short and
opportunities too meagre for many deeds&mdash;besides, the
best friendships are precisely those where there is no
possibility of material helpfulness&mdash;and I would take
no deeds as an adequate compensation for the frigid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
glassy eye and hard, indifferent tones of one's very
solid and sensible and conscientious friend. You will
wonder of what this is <i>à propos</i>&mdash;only of a little bitterness
in my own soul just at this moment, and not
of anything between you and me. I have nothing to
tell you, for all the "haps" of my life are so indifferent.
I spin my existence so entirely out of myself
that there is a sad want of proper names in my conversation,
and I am becoming a greater bore than
ever. It is a consciousness of this that has kept me
from writing to you. My letters would be a sort of
hermit's diary. I have so liked the thought of your
enjoying the "Nemesis of Faith." I quote Keats's
sonnet, <i>à propos</i> of that book. It has made me feel&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Like some watcher of the skies<br /></span>

<p>You must read "The Shadows of the Clouds." It
produces a sort of palpitation that one hardly knows
whether to call wretched or delightful. I cannot take up
the book again, though wanting very much to read it
more closely. Poor and shallow as one's own soul is,
it is blessed to think that a sort of transubstantiation
is possible by which the greater ones can live in us.
Egotism apart, another's greatness, beauty, or bliss is
one's own. And let us sing a <i>Magnificat</i> when we are
conscious that this power of expansion and sympathy
is growing, just in proportion as the individual satisfactions
are lessening. Miserable dust of the earth we
are, but it is worth while to be so, for the sake of the
living soul&mdash;the breath of God within us. You see I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
can do nothing but scribble my own prosy stuff&mdash;such
chopped straw as my soul is foddered on. I am translating
the "Tractatus Theologico-Politicus" of Spinoza,
and seem to want the only friend that knows how to
praise or blame. How exquisite is the satisfaction of
feeling that another mind than your own sees precisely
where and what is the difficulty&mdash;and can exactly appreciate
the success with which it is overcome. One
knows&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sed longo intervallo</i>&mdash;the full meaning of the
"fit audience though few." How an artist must hate
the noodles that stare at his picture, with a vague notion
that it <em>is</em> a clever thing to be able to paint.</p>

<p>I know it will gladden your heart to hear that father
spoke of you the other day with affection and gratitude.
He remembers you as one who helped to strengthen
that beautiful spirit of resignation which has never left
him through his long trial. His mind is as clear and
rational as ever, notwithstanding his feebleness, and he
gives me a thousand little proofs that he understands
my affection and responds to it. These are very precious
moments to me; my chair by father's bedside is
a very blessed seat to me. My delight in the idea
that you are being benefited after all, prevents me from
regretting you, though you are just the friend that would
complete my comfort. Every addition to your power
of enjoying life is an expansion of mine. I partake of
your ebb and flow. I am going to my post now. I
have just snatched an interval to let you know that,
though you have taken away a part of yourself from
me, neither you nor any one else can take the whole.</p>

Congreve (who was then Miss Bury, daughter of the
doctor who was attending Mr. Evans&mdash;and who,
it will be seen, subsequently became perhaps the
most intimate and the closest of George Eliot's
friends) tells me that her father told her at the
time that he never saw a patient more admirably
and thoroughly cared for. The translating was a
great relief when she could get to it. Under date
of 19th April, 1849, Mrs. Bray writes to Miss Hennell,
"M. A. is happy now with this Spinoza to do:
she says it is such a rest for her mind."</p>

<p>Dear friends, Mr. Bury told us last night that he thought
father would not last till morning. I sat by him with
my hand in his till four o'clock, and he then became
quieter and has had some comfortable sleep. He is
obviously weaker this morning, and has been for the
last two or three days so painfully reduced that I
dread to think what his dear frame may become before
life gives way. My brother slept here last night, and
will be here again to-night. What shall I be without
my father? It will seem as if a part of my moral nature
were gone. I write when I can, but I do not know
whether my letter will do to send this evening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<blockquote><p>It fortunately happened that the Brays had planned
a trip to the Continent for this month of June,
1849, and Miss Evans, being left desolate by the
death of her father, accepted their invitation to join
them. On the 11th June they started, going by
way of Paris, Lyons, Avignon, Marseilles, Nice,
Genoa, Milan, Como, Lago Maggiore, Martigny,
and Chamounix, arriving at Geneva in the third
week of July. Here Miss Evans determined to remain
for some months, the Brays returning home.
Before they went, however, they helped her to settle
herself comfortably <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en pension</i>, and, as will be
seen from the following letters, the next eight
months were quietly and peacefully happy. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pension</i> selected in the first instance was the Campagne
Plongeon, which stands on a slight eminence
a few hundred yards back from the road
on the route d'Hermance, some ten minutes' walk
from the Hôtel Métropole. From the Hôtel National
on the Quai de Mont Blanc one catches a
pleasant glimpse of it nestling among its trees. A
good-sized, gleaming white house, with a centre,
and gables at each side, a flight of steps leading
from the middle window to the ground. A meadow
in front, nicely planted, slopes charmingly down to
the blue lake, and behind the house, on the left-hand
side, there is an avenue of remarkably fine
chestnut-trees, whence there is a magnificent view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of the Jura mountains on the opposite side of the
lake. The road to Geneva is very beautiful, by the
lake-side, bordered with plane-trees. It was a delightful,
soothing change after the long illness and
the painful death of her father&mdash;after the monotonous
dulness, too, of an English provincial town
like Coventry, where there is little beauty of any
sort to gladden the soul. In the first months following
a great loss it is good to be alone for a
time&mdash;alone, especially amidst beautiful scenes&mdash;and
alone in the sense of being removed from
habitual associations, but yet constantly in the society
of new acquaintances, who are sufficiently interesting,
but not too intimate. The Swiss correspondence
which follows is chiefly addressed to the
Brays collectively, and describes the life minutely.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
27th July,
1840.</div>

<p>About my comfort here, I find no disagreeables, and
have every physical comfort that I care about. The
family seems well-ordered and happy. I have made
another friend, too&mdash;an elderly English lady, a Mrs.
Locke, who used to live at Ryde&mdash;a pretty old lady
with plenty of shrewdness and knowledge of the
world. She began to say very kind things to me in
rather a waspish tone yesterday morning at breakfast.
I liked her better at dinner and tea, and to-day we are
quite confidential. I only hope she will stay; she is
just the sort of person I shall like to have to speak to&mdash;not
at all "congenial," but with a character of her
own. The going down to tea bores me, and I shall
get out of it as soon as I can, unless I can manage to
have the newspapers to read. The American lady
embroiders slippers&mdash;the mamma looks on and does
nothing. The marquis and his friends play at whist;
the old ladies sew; and madame says things so true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that they are insufferable. She is obliged to talk to
all, and cap their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">niaiseries</i> with some suitable observation.
She has been very kind and motherly to me.
I like her better every time I see her. I have quiet
and comfort&mdash;what more can I want to make me a
healthy, reasonable being once more? I will never go
near a friend again until I can bring joy and peace in
my heart and in my face&mdash;but remember that friendship
will be easy then.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
5th Aug.
1849.</div>

<p>I hope my imagination paints truly when it shows
me all of you seated with beaming faces round the tea-table
at Rosehill. I shall be yearning to know that
things as well as people are smiling on you; but I am
sure you will not let me wait for news of you longer
than is necessary. My life here would be delightful if
we could always keep the same set of people; but,
alas! I fear one generation will go and another come
so fast that I shall not care to become acquainted
with any of them. My good Mrs. Locke is not going,
that is one comfort. She is quite a mother to me&mdash;helps
me to buy my candles and do all my shopping&mdash;takes
care of me at dinner, and quite rejoices when
she sees me enjoy conversation or anything else. The
St. Germains are delightful people&mdash;the marquise really
seems to me the most charming person I ever saw,
with kindness enough to make the ultra-politeness of
her manners quite genuine. She is very good to me,
and says of me, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je m'interesse vivement à mademoiselle.</span>"
The marquis is the most well-bred, harmless
of men. He talks very little&mdash;every sentence seems a
terrible gestation, and comes forth <i>fortissimo</i>; but he
generally bestows one on me, and seems especially to
enjoy my poor tunes (mind you, all these trivialities
are to satisfy your vanity, not mine&mdash;because you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
beginning to be ashamed of having loved me). The
gray-headed gentleman got quite fond of talking philosophy
with me before he went; but, alas! he and a
very agreeable young man who was with him are gone
to Aix les Bains. The young German is the Baron
de H&mdash;&mdash;. I should think he is not more than two
or three and twenty, very good-natured, but a most
determined enemy to all gallantry. I fancy he is a
Communist; but he seems to have been joked about
his opinions by madame and the rest until he has determined
to keep a proud silence on such matters.
He has begun to talk to me, and I think we should
become good friends; but he, too, is gone on an expedition
to Monte Rosa. He is expecting his brother to
join him here on his return, but I fear they will not
stay long. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouvernante</i> is a German, with a moral
region that would rejoice Mr. Bray's eyes. Poor soul,
she is in a land of strangers, and often seems to feel
her loneliness. Her situation is a very difficult one;
and "<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Angst</i>," she says, often brings on a pain at
her heart. Madame is a woman of some reading and
considerable talent&mdash;very fond of politics, a devourer
of the journals, with an opinion ready for you on any
subject whatever. It will be a serious loss to her to
part with the St. Germain family. I fear that they will
not stay longer than this month. I should be quite
indifferent to the world that comes or goes if once I
had my boxes with all my books. Last Sunday I went
with madame to a small church near Plongeon, and I
could easily have fancied myself in an Independent
chapel at home. The spirit of the sermon was not a
whit more elevated than that of our friend Dr. Harris;
the text, "What shall I do to be saved?" the answer
of Jesus being blinked as usual.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>To-day I have been to hear one of the most celebrated
preachers, M. Meunier. His sermon was really
eloquent&mdash;all written down, but delivered with so
much energy and feeling that you never thought of
the book. It is curious to notice how patriotism&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dévouement
à la patrie</i>&mdash;is put in the sermons as the
first of virtues, even before devotion to the Church.
We never hear of it in England after we leave school.
The good marquis goes with his family and servants,
all nicely dressed, to the Catholic Church. They are
a most orderly set of people: there is nothing but
their language and their geniality and politeness to
distinguish them from one of the best of our English
aristocratic families. I am perfectly comfortable; every
one is kind to me and seems to like me. Your
kind hearts will rejoice at this, I know. Only remember
that I am just as much interested in all that happens
to you at Rosehill as you are in what happens to
me at Plongeon. Pray that the motto of Geneva may
become mine&mdash;"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Post tenebras lux</i>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
20th Aug.
1849.</div>

<p>I have no head for writing to-day, for I have been
keeping my bed for the last three days; but I must
remember that writing to you is like ringing a bell
hung in the planet Jupiter&mdash;it is so weary a while before
one's letters reach. I have been positively sickening
for want of my boxes, and anxiety to hear of my
relations. Your kind letter of this morning has quieted
the latter a little; but my boxes, alas! have not
appeared. Do not be alarmed about my health. I
have only had a terrible headache&mdash;prolonged, in
fact, by the assiduities of the good people here; for
the first day I lay in my bed I had the whole female
world of Plongeon in my bedroom, and talked so incessantly
that I was unable to sleep after it; the consequence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
as you may imagine, was that the next day
I was very much worse; but I am getting better, and
indeed it was worth while to be ill to have so many
kind attentions. There is a fresh German family from
Frankfurt here just now&mdash;Madame Cornelius and her
children. She is the daughter of the richest banker in
Frankfurt, and, what is better, full of heart and mind,
with a face that tells you so before she opens her lips.
She has more reading than the marquise, being German
and Protestant; and it is a real refreshment to
talk with her for half an hour. The dear marquise is
a truly devout Catholic. It is beautiful to hear her
speak of the comfort she has in the confessional&mdash;for
our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">têtes-à-tête</i> have lately turned on religious matters.
She says I am in a "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise voie sous le rapport de
la religion. Peut être vous vous marierez, et le mariage,
chère amie, sans la foi religieuse!</span>..." She
says I have isolated myself by my studies&mdash;that I am
too cold and have too little confidence in the feelings
of others towards me&mdash;that I do not believe how deep
an interest she has conceived in my lot. She says
Signor Goldrini (the young Italian who was here for a
week) told her, when he had been talking to me one
evening, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous aimerez cette demoiselle, j'en suis
sûr</span>"&mdash;and she has found his prediction true. They
are leaving for their own country on Wednesday. She
hopes I shall go to Italy and see her; and when I tell
her that I have no faith that she will remember me
long enough for me to venture on paying her a visit if
ever I should go to Italy again, she shakes her head at
my incredulity. She was born at Genoa. Her father
was three years Sardinian Minister at Constantinople
before she was married, and she speaks with enthusiasm
of her life there&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est là le pays de la vraie</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poésie ou l'on sent ce que c'est que de vivre par le
c&oelig;ur.</span>" M. de H&mdash;&mdash; is returned from Monte Rosa.
He would be a nice person if he had another soul
added to the one he has by nature&mdash;the soul that
comes by sorrow and love. I stole his book while he
was gone&mdash;the first volume of Louis Blanc's "History
of Ten Years." It contains a very interesting account
of the three days of July, 1830. His brother is coming
to join him, so I hope he will not go at present.
Tell Miss Sibree my address, and beg her to write to
me all about herself, and to write on thin paper. I
hardly know yet whether I shall like this place well
enough to stay here through the winter. I have been
under the disadvantage of wanting all on which I
chiefly depend, my books, etc. When I have been
here another month I shall be better able to judge.
I hope you managed to get in the black velvet dress.
The people dress, and think about dressing, here more
even than in England. You would not know me if
you saw me. The marquise took on her the office of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de chambre</i> and dressed my hair one day. She
has abolished all my curls, and made two things stick
out on each side of my head like those on the head of
the Sphinx. All the world says I look infinitely better;
so I comply, though to myself I seem uglier than
ever&mdash;if possible. I am fidgeted to death about my
boxes, and that tiresome man not to acknowledge the
receipt of them. I make no apology for writing all my
peevishness and follies, because I want you to do the
same&mdash;to let me know everything about you, to the
aching of your fingers&mdash;and you tell me very little.
My boxes, my boxes! I dream of them night and day.
Dear Mr. Hennell! Give him my heartiest affectionate
remembrances. Tell him I find no one here so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
spirited as he: there are no better jokes going than I
can make myself. Mrs. Hennell and Mrs. C. Hennell,
too, all are remembered&mdash;if even I have only seen
them in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
28th Aug.
1849.</div>

<p>Mme. de Ludwigsdorff, the wife of an Austrian baron,
has been here for two days, and is coming again.
She is handsome, spirited, and clever&mdash;pure English
by birth, but quite foreign in manners and appearance.
She, and all the world besides, are going to winter in
Italy. Nothing annoys me now; I feel perfectly at
home, and shall really be comfortable when I have all
my little matters about me. This place looks more
lovely to me every day&mdash;the lake, the town, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">campagnes</i>,
with their stately trees and pretty houses, the
glorious mountains in the distance; one can hardly
believe one's self on earth; one might live here, and
forget that there is such a thing as want or labor or
sorrow. The perpetual presence of all this beauty has
somewhat the effect of mesmerism or chloroform. I
feel sometimes as if I were sinking into an agreeable
state of numbness, on the verge of unconsciousness,
and seem to want well pinching to rouse me. The
other day (Sunday) there was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> held on the lake&mdash;the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> of Navigation. I went out, with some other
ladies, in M. de H&mdash;&mdash;'s boat, at sunset, and had the
richest draught of beauty. All the boats of Geneva
turned out in their best attire. When the moon and
stars came out there were beautiful fireworks sent up
from the boats. The mingling of the silver and the
golden rays on the rippled lake, the bright colors of
the boats, the music, the splendid fireworks, and the
pale moon looking at it all with a sort of grave surprise,
made up a scene of perfect enchantment; and
our dear old Mont Blanc was there, in his white ermine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
robe. I rowed all the time, and hence comes my palsy.
I can perfectly fancy dear Mrs. Pears in her Leamington
house. How beautiful all that Foleshill life looks
now, like the distant Jura in the morning! She was
such a sweet, dear, good friend to me. My walks with
her, my little visits to them in the evening&mdash;all is remembered.
I am glad you have seen Fanny again;
any attention you show her is a real kindness to me,
and I assure you she is worth it. You know, or, you
do not know, that my nature is so chameleon-like I
shall lose all my identity unless you keep nourishing the
old self with letters; so, pray, write as much and as
often as you can. It jumps admirably with my humor
to live in two worlds at once in this way. I possess
my dearest friends and my old environment in my
thoughts, and another world of novelty and beauty in
which I am actually moving, and my contrariety of
disposition always makes the world that lives in my
thoughts the dearer of the two, the one in which I
more truly dwell. So, after all, I enjoy my friends
most when I am away from them. I shall not say so,
though, if I should live to rejoin you six or seven months
hence. Keep me for seven<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
years longer, and you
will find out the use of me, like all other pieces of trumpery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to Mrs.
Houghton,
6th Sept.
1849.</div>

<p>Have I confided too much in your generosity in supposing
that you would write to me first? or is there
some other reason for your silence? I suffer greatly
from it&mdash;not entirely from selfish reasons, but in great
part because I am really anxious to know all about
you, your state of health and spirits, the aspect of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
things within and without you. Did Mr. Bray convey
to you my earnest request that you would write to me?
You know of my whereabouts and circumstances from
my good friends at Rosehill, so that I have little to
tell you; at least, I have not spirit to write of myself
until I have heard from you, and have an assurance
from yourself that you yet care about me. Sara (Mrs.
Isaac Evans) has sent me word of the sad, sad loss
that has befallen poor Chrissey and Edward&mdash;a loss in
which I feel that I have a share; for that angelic little
being had great interest for me; she promised to pay
so well for any care spent on her. I can imagine poor
Edward's almost frantic grief, and I dread the effect
on Chrissey's weak frame of her more silent suffering.
Anything you can tell me about them will be read very
eagerly. I begin to feel the full value of a letter; so
much so that, if ever I am convinced that any one has
the least anxiety to hear from me, I shall always reckon
it among the first duties to sit down without delay,
giving no ear to the suggestions of my idleness and
aversion to letter-writing. Indeed, I am beginning to
find it really pleasant to write to my friends, now that
I am so far away from them; and I could soon fill a
sheet to you, if your silence did not weigh too heavily
on my heart. My health is by no means good yet;
seldom good enough not to be a sort of drag on my
mind; so you must make full allowance for too much
egotism and susceptibility in me. It seems to be three
years instead of three months since I was in England
and amongst you, and I imagine that all sorts of revolutions
must have taken place in the interim; whereas
to you, I dare say, remaining in your old home and
among your every-day duties, the time has slipped
away so rapidly that you are unable to understand my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
anxiety to hear from you. I think the climate here is
not particularly healthy; I suppose, from the vicinity
of the lake, which, however, becomes so dear to me
that one cannot bear to hear it accused. Good-bye,
dear Fanny; a thousand blessings to you, whether you
write to me or not, and much gratitude if you do.</p>

fr. 150&mdash;perfectly horrible! Clearly, I must give myself
for food to the fowls of the air or the fishes of the
lake. It is a consolation to a mind imbued with a
lofty philosophy that, when one can get nothing to eat,
one can still be eaten&mdash;the evil is only apparent. It is
quite settled that I cannot stay at Plongeon; I must
move into town. But, alas! I must pay fr. 200 per
month. If I were there I should see more conversable
people than here. Do you think any one would buy
my "Encyclopædia Britannica" at half-price, and my
globes? If so, I should not be afraid of exceeding
my means, and I should have a little money to pay for
my piano, and for some lessons of different kinds that
I want to take. The "Encyclopædia" is the last edition,
and cost £42, and the globes £8 10<i>s.</i> I shall never
have anywhere to put them, so it is folly to keep them,
if any one will buy them. No one else has written to
me, though I have written to almost all. I would
rather have it so than feel that the debt was on my
side. When will you come to me for help, that I may
be able to hate you a little less? I shall leave here as
soon as I am able to come to a decision, as I am anxious
to feel settled, and the weather is becoming cold.
This house is like a bird-cage set down in a garden.
Do not count this among my letters. I am good for
nothing to-day, and can write nothing well but bitterness,
so that I will not trust myself to say another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
word. The Baronne de Ludwigsdorff seems to have
begun to like me very much, and is really kind; so
you see Heaven sends kind souls, though they are by
no means kindred ones. Poor Mrs. Locke is to write
to me&mdash;has given me a little ring; says, "Take care of
yourself, my child&mdash;have some tea of your own&mdash;you'll
be quite another person if you get some introductions
to clever people; you'll get on well among a certain
set&mdash;that's true;" it is her way to say "that's true"
after all her affirmations. She says, "You won't find
any kindred spirits at Plongeon, my dear."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,

<p>I am feeling particularly happy because I have had
very kind letters from my brother and sisters. I am
ashamed to fill sheets about myself, but I imagined
that this was precisely what you wished. Pray correct
my mistake, if it be one, and then I will look over the
Calvin manuscripts, and give you some information of
really general interest, suited to our mutual capacities.
Mme. Ludwigsdorff is so good to me&mdash;a charming
creature&mdash;so anxious to see me comfortably settled&mdash;petting
me in all sorts of ways. She sends me tea
when I wake in the morning&mdash;orange-flower water
when I go to bed&mdash;grapes&mdash;and her maid to wait on
me. She says if I like she will spend the winter after
this at Paris with me, and introduce me to her friends
there; but she does not mean to attach herself to me,
because I shall never like her long. I shall be tired
of her when I have sifted her, etc. She says I have
more intellect than <i>morale</i>, and other things more true
than agreeable; however, she is "greatly interested"
in me; has told me her troubles and her feelings, she
says, in spite of herself; for she has never been able
before in her life to say so much even to her old friends.
It is a mystery she cannot unravel. She is a person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of high culture, according to the ordinary notions of
what feminine culture should be. She speaks French
and German perfectly, plays well, and has the most
perfect polish of manner&mdash;the most thorough refinement,
both socially and morally. She is tall and handsome,
a striking-looking person, but with a sweet feminine
expression when she is with those she likes;
dresses exquisitely; in fine, is all that I am not. I
shall tire you with all this, but I want you to know
what good creatures there are here as elsewhere.
Miss F. tells me that the first day she sat by my side
at dinner she looked at me and thought to herself,
"That is a grave lady; I do not think I shall like her
much;" but as soon as I spoke to her, and she looked
into my eyes, she felt she could love me. Then she
lent me a book written by her cousin&mdash;a religious novel&mdash;in
which there is a fearful infidel who will not believe,
and hates all who do, etc. Then she invited me to
walk with her, and came to talk in my room; then invited
me to go to the Oratoire with them, till I began
to be uncomfortable under the idea that they fancied
I was evangelical, and that I was gaining their affection
under false pretences; so I told Miss F. that I
was going to sacrifice her good opinion, and confess
my heresies. I quite expected, from their manner and
character, that they would forsake me in horror&mdash;but
they are as kind as ever. They never go into the <i>salon</i>
in the evening, and I have almost forsaken it, spending
the evening frequently in Mme. de Ludwigsdorff's
room, where we have some delightful tea. The tea of
the house here is execrable; or, rather, as Mrs. A.
says, "How glad we ought to be that it has no taste
at all; it might have a very bad one!" I like the A.'s;
they are very good-natured. Mrs. A., a very ugly but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
lady-like little woman, who is under an infatuation "as
it regards" her caps&mdash;always wearing the brightest
rose-color or intensest blue&mdash;with a complexion not unlike
a dirty primrose glove. The rest of the people
are nothing to me, except, indeed, dear old Mlle. de
Phaisan, who comes into my room when I am ill, with
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qu'est ce que vous avez, ma bonne?</span>" in the tone of
the kindest old aunt, and thinks that I am the most
amiable douce creature, which will give you a better
opinion of her charity than her penetration.</p>

<p>Dear creatures! no one is so good as you yet. I
have not yet found any one who can bear comparison
with you; not in kindness to me&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ça va sans dire</i>&mdash;but
in solidity of mind and in expansion of feeling. This
is a very coarse thing to say, but it came to the end
of my pen, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litera scripta manet</i>&mdash;at least, when it
comes at the end of the second page. I shall certainly
stay at Geneva this winter, and shall return to England
as early as the spring weather will permit, always
supposing that nothing occurs to alter my plans. I
am still thin; so how much will be left of me next
April I am afraid to imagine. I shall be length without
breadth. Cara's assurance that you are well and
comfortable is worth a luncheon to me, which is just
the thing I am generally most in want of, for we dine
at six now. I love to imagine you in your home; and
everything seems easy to me when I am not disturbed
about the health or well-being of my loved ones. It is
really so; I do not say it out of any sort of affectation,
benevolent or otherwise. I am without carefulness,
alas! in more senses than one. Thank Sara very
heartily for her letter. I do not write a special sheet
for her to-day, because I have to write to two or three
other people, but she must not the less believe how I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
valued a little private morsel from her; and also that
I would always rather she wrote "from herself" than
"to me"&mdash;that is my theory of letter-writing. Your
letters are as welcome as Elijah's ravens&mdash;I thought
of saying the dinner-bell, only that would be too gross!
I get impatient at the end of the ten days which it
takes for our letters to go to and fro; and I have not
the least faith in the necessity for keeping the sheet
three or four days before Mr. Bray can find time to
write his meagre bit. If you see the Miss Franklins,
give my love to them; my remembrances to Mr. and
Mrs. Whittem; love to Miss Sibree always. Hearty
love to Clapton<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and Woodford;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
and a very diffusive
benevolence to the world in general, without any particular
attachment to A or B. I am trying to please
Mr. Bray. Good-bye, dear souls. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus vobiscum.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
Thursday,
4th Oct.
1849.</div>

<p>I am anxious for you to know my new address, as I
shall leave here on Tuesday. I think I have at last
found the very thing. I shall be the only lodger. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">appartement</i> is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">assez joli</i>, with an alcove, so that it looks
like a sitting-room in the daytime&mdash;the people, an
artist of great respectability, and his wife, a most kind-looking,
lady-like person, with two boys, who have the
air of being well educated. They seem very anxious
to have me, and are ready to do anything to accommodate
me. I shall live with them&mdash;that is, dine with
them; breakfast in my own room. The terms are
fr. 150 per month, light included. M. and Mme.
d'Albert are middle-aged, musical, and, I am told,
have <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaucoup d'esprit</i>. I hope this will not exceed
my means for four or five months. There is a nice,
large <i>salon</i> and a good <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle à manger</i>. I am told that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
their society is very good. Mme. de Ludwigsdorff was
about going there a year ago, and it was she who recommended
it to me.</p>

<p>I hope Sara's fears are supererogatory&mdash;a proof of
a too nervous solicitude about me, for which I am
grateful, though it does me no good to hear of it. I
want encouraging rather than warning and checking.
I believe I am so constituted that I shall never be
cured of my faults except by God's discipline. If human
beings would but believe it, they do me the most
good by saying to me the kindest things truth will permit;
and really I cannot hope those will be superlatively
kind. The reason I wished to raise a little extra
money is that I wanted to have some lessons and
other means of culture&mdash;not for my daily bread, for
which I hope I shall have enough; but, since you
think my scheme impracticable, we will dismiss it. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au
reste</i>, be in no anxiety about me. Nothing is going
wrong that I know of. I am not an absolute fool and
weakling. When I am fairly settled in my new home
I will write again. My address will be&mdash;M. d'Albert
Durade, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue des Chanoines</span>, No. 107.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to Mrs.
Houghton,
4th Oct.
1849.</div>

<p>The blessed compensation there is in all things
made your letter doubly precious for having been
waited for, and it would have inspired me to write to
you again much sooner, but that I have been in uncertainty
about settling myself for the winter, and I wished
to send you my future address. I am to move to my
new home on Tuesday the 9th. I shall not at all regret
leaving here; the season is beginning to be rather
sombre, though the glorious chestnuts here are still
worth looking at half the day. You have heard of some
of the people whom I have described in my letters to
Rosehill. The dear little old maid, Mlle. de Phaisan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
is quite a good friend to me&mdash;extremely prosy, and full
of tiny details; but really people of that calibre are a
comfort to one occasionally, when one has not strength
enough for more stimulating things. She is a sample
of those happy souls who ask for nothing but the work
of the hour, however trivial; who are contented to live
without knowing whether they effect anything, but who
do really effect much good, simply by their calm and
even <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maintien</i>. I laugh to hear her say in a tone of
remonstrance&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mme. de Ludwigsdorff dit qu'elle
s'ennuie quand les soirées sont longues: moi, je ne
conçois pas comment on peut s'ennuyer quand on a
de l'ouvrage ou des jeux ou de la conversation.</span>" When
people who are dressing elegantly and driving about
to make calls every day of their life have been telling
me of their troubles&mdash;their utter hopelessness of ever
finding a vein worth working in their future life&mdash;my
thoughts have turned towards many whose sufferings
are of a more tangible character, and I have really
felt all the old commonplaces about the equality of
human destinies, always excepting those spiritual differences
which are apart not only from poverty and
riches, but from individual affections. Dear Chrissey
has found time and strength to write to me, and very
precious her letter was, though I wept over it. "Deep,
abiding grief must be mine," she says, and I know
well it must be. The mystery of trial! It falls with
such avalanche weight on the head of the meek and
patient. I wish I could do something of more avail
for my friends than love them and long for their happiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
11th Oct.
1849.</div>

<p>M. and Mme. d'Albert are really clever people&mdash;people
worth sitting up an hour longer to talk to. This
does not hinder madame from being an excellent manager&mdash;dressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
scrupulously, and keeping her servants
in order. She has hung my room with pictures, one
of which is the most beautiful group of flowers conceivable
thrown on an open Bible, painted by herself.
I have a piano which I hire. There is also one in the
<i>salon</i>. M. d'Albert plays and sings, and in the winter
he tells me they have parties to sing masses and do
other delightful things. In fact, I think I am just in
the right place. I breakfast in my own room at half-past
eight, lunch at half-past twelve, and dine at four
or a little after, and take tea at eight. From the tea-table
I have gone into the <i>salon</i> and chatted until bedtime.
It would really have been a pity to have stayed
at Plongeon, out of reach of everything, and with people
so little worth talking to. I have not found out
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">desagrémens</i> here yet. It is raining horribly, but
this just saves me from the regret I should have felt at
having quitted the chestnuts of Plongeon. That <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">campagne</i>
looked splendid in its autumn dress.</p>

<blockquote><p>George Eliot retained so warm an admiration
and love for M. d'Albert Durade to the end of her
life that it seems fitting here to mention that he
still lives, carrying well the weight of eighty winters.
He is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conservateur</i> of the Athénée&mdash;a permanent
exhibition of works of art in Geneva; and he published
only last year (1883) a French translation
of the "Scenes of Clerical Life," having already
previously published translations of "Adam Bede,"
"Felix Holt," "Silas Marner," and "Romola."
The description of his personal appearance, in the
following letter, still holds good, save that the gray
hair has become quite white. He lost his wife in
1873; and it will be seen from subsequent letters
that George Eliot kept up a faithful attachment to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
her to the end. They were both friends after her
own heart. The old apartment is now No. 18, instead
of No. 107, Rue des Chanoines, and is occupied
as the printing-office of the <cite>Journal de Genève</cite>.
But half of the rooms remain just as they were five-and-thirty
years ago. The <i>salon</i>, wainscoted in imitation
light-oak panels, with a white China stove,
and her bedroom opening off it&mdash;as she had often
described it to me; and M. d'Albert has still in his
possession the painting of the bunch of beautiful
flowers thrown on an open Bible mentioned in the
last letter. He told me that when Miss Evans first
came to look at the house she was so horrified with
the forbidding aspect of the stairs that she declared
she would not go up above the first floor; but when
she got inside the door she was reconciled to her
new quarters. Calvin's house is close to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue
des Chanoines</span>, and she was much interested in it.
It will be seen that she did some work in physics
under Professor de la Rive; but she principally
rested and enjoyed herself during the stay at
Geneva. It was exactly the kind of life she was
in need of at the time, and the letters show how
much she appreciated it.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
26th Oct.
1849.</div>

<p>I languished for your letter before it came, and read it
three times running&mdash;judge whether I care less for you
than of old. It is the best of blessings to know that
you are well and cheerful; and when I think of all that
might happen in a fortnight to make you otherwise,
especially in these days of cholera and crises, I cannot
help being anxious until I get a fresh assurance that at
least five days ago all was well. Before I say anything
about myself, I must contradict your suspicion that I
paint things too agreeably for the sake of giving you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
pleasure. I assure you my letters are subjectively true;
the falsehood, if there be any, is in my manner of
seeing things. But I will give you some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vérités positives</i>,
in which, alas! poor imagination has hitherto been able
to do little for the world. Mme. d'Albert anticipates
all my wants, and makes a spoiled child of me. I like
these dear people better and better&mdash;everything is so
in harmony with one's moral feeling that I really can
almost say I never enjoyed a more complete <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien être</i>
in my life than during the last fortnight. For M.
d'Albert, I love him already as if he were father and
brother both. His face is rather haggard-looking, but
all the lines and the wavy gray hair indicate the temperament
of the artist. I have not heard a word or
seen a gesture of his yet that was not perfectly in harmony
with an exquisite moral refinement&mdash;indeed, one
feels a better person always when he is present. He
sings well, and plays on the piano a little. It is delightful
to hear him talk of his friends&mdash;he admires
them so genuinely&mdash;one sees so clearly that there is
no reflex egotism. His conversation is charming. I
learn something every dinner-time. Mme. d'Albert
has less of genius and more of cleverness&mdash;a really
lady-like person, who says everything well. She brings
up her children admirably&mdash;two nice, intelligent boys;
<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
&mdash;the
youngest, particularly, has a sort of Lamartine
expression, with a fine head. It is so delightful to get
among people who exhibit no meannesses, no worldlinesses,
that one may well be enthusiastic. To me it is
so blessed to find any departure from the rule of giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
as little as possible for as much as possible. Their
whole behavior to me is as if I were a guest whom they
delighted to honor. Last night we had a little knot
of their most intimate musical friends, and M. and
Mme. d'Albert introduced me to them as if they wished
me to know them&mdash;as if they wished me to like their
friends and their friends to like me. The people and
the evening would have been just after your own hearts.
In fact, I have not the slightest pretext for being discontented&mdash;not
the shadow of a discomfort. Even the
little housemaid Jeanne is charming; says to me every
morning, in the prettiest voice: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame a-t-elle bien
dormi cette nuit?</span>"&mdash;puts fire in my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chauffe-pied</i> without
being told&mdash;cleans my rooms most conscientiously.
There&mdash;I promise to weary you less for the future with
my descriptions. I could not resist the temptation to
speak gratefully of M. and Mme. d'Albert.</p>

<p>Give my love to Mrs. Pears&mdash;my constant, ever-fresh
remembrance. My love to Miss Rebecca Franklin&mdash;tell
her I have only spun my web to Geneva; it will
infallibly carry me back again across the gulf, were it
twice as great. If Mr. Froude preach the new word
at Manchester, I hope he will preach it so as to do
without an after-explanation, and not bewilder his
hearers in the manner of Mephistopheles when he dons
the doctor's gown of Faust. I congratulate you on the
new edition,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
and promise to read it with a disposition
to admire when I am at Rosehill once more. I am
beginning to lose respect for the petty acumen that
sees difficulties. I love the souls that rush along to
their goal with a full stream of sentiment&mdash;that have
too much of the positive to be harassed by the perpetual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
negatives&mdash;which, after all, are but the disease
of the soul, to be expelled by fortifying the principle
of vitality.</p>

<p>Good-bye, dear loves; sha'n't I kiss you when I am
in England again&mdash;in England! I already begin to
think of the journey as an impossibility. Geneva is
so beautiful now, the trees have their richest coloring.
Coventry is a fool to it&mdash;but, then, you are at Coventry,
and you are better than lake, trees, and mountains.</p>

<p>We have had some delicious autumn days here. If
the fine weather last, I am going up the Salève on
Sunday with M. d'Albert. On one side I shall have a
magnificent view of the lake, the town, and the Jura;
on the other, the range of Mont Blanc. The walks
about Geneva are perfectly enchanting. "Ah!" says
poor Mlle. de Phaisan, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nous avons un beau pays si

the Conseil d'État is to take place in November, and
an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émeute</i> is expected. The actual government is
Radical, and thoroughly detested by all the "respectable"
classes. The vice-president of the Conseil and
the virtual head of the government is an unprincipled,
clever fellow, horribly in debt himself, and on the way
to reduce the government to the same position.</p>

<p>I like my town life vastly. I shall like it still better
in the winter. There is an indescribable charm to me
in this form of human nest-making. You enter a by
no means attractive-looking house, you climb up two
or three flights of cold, dark-looking stone steps, you
ring at a very modest door, and you enter a set of
rooms, snug, or comfortable, or elegant. One is so out
of reach of intruders, so undiverted from one's occupations
by externals, so free from cold, rushing winds
through hall doors&mdash;one feels in a downy nest high up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in a good old tree. I have always had a hankering
after this sort of life, and I find it was a true instinct
of what would suit me. Just opposite my windows is
the street in which the Sisters of Charity live, and, if I
look out, I generally see either one of them or a sober-looking
ecclesiastic. Then a walk of five minutes takes
me out of all streets, within sight of beauties that I am
sure you too would love, if you did not share my enthusiasm
for the town. I have not another minute,
having promised to go out before dinner&mdash;so, dearest,
take my letter as a hasty kiss, just to let you know how
constantly I love you&mdash;how, the longer I live and the
more I have felt, the better I know how to value you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I write at once to answer your questions about business.
Spinoza and I have been divorced for several
months. My want of health has obliged me to renounce
all application. I take walks, play on the piano,
read Voltaire, talk to my friends, and just take a dose of
mathematics every day to prevent my brain from becoming
quite soft. If you are anxious to publish the
translation in question I could, after a few months,
finish the "Tractatus Theologico-Politicus" to keep it
company; but I confess to you that I think you would
do better to abstain from printing a translation. What
is wanted in English is not a translation of Spinoza's
works, but a true estimate of his life and system. After
one has rendered his Latin faithfully into English,
one feels that there is another yet more difficult process
of translation for the reader to effect, and that the
only mode of making Spinoza accessible to a larger
number is to study his books, then shut them, and give
an analysis. For those who read the very words
Spinoza wrote there is the same sort of interest in his
style as in the conversation of a person of great capacity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
who has led a solitary life, and who says from his
own soul what all the world is saying by rote; but this
interest hardly belongs to a translation.</p>

<p>Your letter is very sweet to me, giving me a picture
of your quiet life. How shall I enable you to imagine
mine, since you know nothing of the localities? My
good friends here only change for the better. Mme.
d'Albert is all affection; M. d'Albert all delicacy and
intelligence; the friends to whom they have introduced
me very kind in their attentions. In fact, I want
nothing but a little more money, to feel more at ease
about my fires, etc. I am in an atmosphere of love
and refinement; even the little servant Jeanne seems
to love me, and does me good every time she comes
into the room. I can say anything to M. and Mme.
d'Albert. M. d'A. understands everything, and if madame
does not understand, she believes&mdash;that is, she
seems always sure that I mean something edifying.
She kisses me like a mother, and I am baby enough
to find that a great addition to my happiness. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au
reste</i>, I am careful for nothing; I am a sort of supernumerary
spoon, and there will be no damage to the
set if I am lost. My heart-ties are not loosened by
distance&mdash;it is not in the nature of ties to be so; and
when I think of my loved ones as those to whom I
can be a comforter, a help, I long to be with them
again. Otherwise, I can only think with a shudder
of returning to England. It looks to me like a land
of gloom, of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>, of platitude; but in the midst of
all this it is the land of duty and affection, and the
only ardent hope I have for my future life is to have
given to me some woman's duty&mdash;some possibility of
devoting myself where I may see a daily result of pure,
calm blessedness in the life of another.

<p>How do you look? I hope that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bandeau</i> of silvery
locks is not widening too fast on the head I love so
well&mdash;that the eyes are as bright as ever. Your letter
tells me they will beam as kindly as ever when
I see them once more. Never make apologies about
your letters, or your words, or anything else. It is
your soul to which I am wedded; and do I not know
too well how the soul is doubly belied&mdash;first, by the
impossibility of being in word and act as great, as loving,
as good as it wills to be; and again, by the miserable
weaknesses of the friends who see the words and
acts through all sorts of mists raised by their own
passions and preoccupations? In all these matters
I am the chief of sinners, and I am tempted to rejoice
in the offences of my friends, because they make me
feel less humiliation. I am quite satisfied to be at
Geneva instead of Paris; in fact, I am becoming passionately
attached to the mountains, the lake, the
streets, my own room, and, above all, the dear people
with whom I live.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
23d Dec.
1849.</div>

<p>A thousand Christmas pleasures and blessings to
you&mdash;good resolutions and bright hopes for the New
Year! Amen. People who can't be witty exert
themselves to be pious or affectionate. Henceforth I
tell you nothing whatever about myself; for if I speak
of agreeables, and say I am contented, Mr. Bray
writes me word that you are all trying to forget me.
If I were to tell you of disagreeables and privations
and sadness, Sara would write: "If you are unhappy
now, you will be so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à fortiori</i> ten years hence." Now,
since I have a decided objection to doses sent by
post which upset one's digestion for a fortnight, I am
determined to give you no pretext for sending them.
You shall not know whether I am well or ill, contented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
or discontented, warm or cold, fat or thin. But
remember that I am so far from being of the same
mind as Mr. Bray, that good news of you is necessary
to my comfort. I walk more briskly, and jump out of
bed more promptly, after a letter that tells me you are
well and comfortable, that business is promising, that
men begin to speak well of you, etc. "I am comforted
in your comfort," as saith St. Paul to the troublesome
Corinthians. When one is cabined, cribbed,
confined in one's self, it is good to be enlarged in
one's friends. Good Mr. Marshall! We wish to keep
even unamiable people when death calls for them,
much more good souls like him. I am glad he had
had one more pleasant visit to Cara for her to think
of. Dear Sara's letter is very charming&mdash;not at all
physicky&mdash;rather an agreeable draught of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin sucré</i>.
Dear Mr. Hennell, we shall never look upon his like.</p>

<p>I am attending a course of lectures on Experimental
Physics by M. le Professeur de la Rive, the inventor,
among other things, of electroplating. The lectures
occur every Wednesday and Saturday. It is
time for me to go. I am distressed to send you this
shabby last fragment of paper, and to write in such a
hurry, but the days are really only two hours long, and
I have so many things to do that I go to bed every
night miserable because I have left out something I
meant to do. Good-bye, dear souls. Forget me if
you like, you cannot oblige me to forget you; and the
active is worth twice of the passive all the world over!
The earth is covered with snow, and the government
is levelling the fortifications.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
28th Jan.
1850.</div>

<p>You leave me a long time without news of you,
though I told you they were necessary as a counteractive
to the horrors of this terrible winter. Are you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
really so occupied as to have absolutely no time to
think of me? I console myself, at least to-day, now
we have a blue sky once more after two months of
mist, with thinking that I am excluded by pleasanter
ideas&mdash;that at least you are well and comfortable, and
I ought to content myself with that. The fact is, I
am much of Touchstone's mind&mdash;in respect my life is
at Geneva, I like it very well, but in respect it is not
with you, it is a very vile life. I have no yearnings to
exchange lake and mountains for Bishop Street and
the Radford Fields, but I have a great yearning to
kiss you all and talk to you for three days running.
I do not think it will be possible for me to undertake
the journey before the end of March. I look forward
to it with great dread. I see myself looking utterly
miserable, ready to leave all my luggage behind me at
Paris for the sake of escaping the trouble of it. We
have had Alboni here&mdash;a very fat siren. There has
been some capital acting of comedies by friends of
M. d'Albert&mdash;one of them is superior to any professional
actor of comedy I have ever seen. He reads
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vaudevilles</i> so marvellously that one seems to have a
whole troupe of actors before one in his single person.
He is a handsome man of fifty, full of wit and
talent, and he married about a year ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>It is one of the provoking contrarieties of destiny
that I should have written my croaking letter when
your own kind, consolatory one was on its way to me.
I have been happier ever since it came. After mourning
two or three months over Chrissey's account of
your troubles, I can only dwell on that part of your
letter which tells that there is a little more blue in your
sky&mdash;that you have faith in the coming spring. Shall
you be as glad to see me as to hear the cuckoo? I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
mean to return to England as soon as the Jura is
passable without sledges&mdash;probably the end of March
or beginning of April. I have a little <i>Heimweh</i> "as it
regards" my friends. I yearn to see those I have
loved the longest, but I shall feel real grief at parting
from the excellent people with whom I am living. I
feel they are my <em>friends</em>; without entering into or even
knowing the greater part of my views, they understand
my character and have a real interest in me. I have
infinite tenderness from Mme. d'Albert. I call her always
"maman;" and she is just the creature one loves
to lean on and be petted by. In fact, I am too much
indulged, and shall go back to England as undisciplined
as ever. This terribly severe winter has been a
drawback on my recovering my strength. I have lost
whole weeks from headache, etc., but I am certainly
better now than when I came to Mme. d'Albert. You
tell me to give you these details, so I obey. Decidedly
England is the most comfortable country to be in
in winter&mdash;at least, for all except those who are rich
enough to buy English comforts everywhere. I hate
myself for caring about carpets, easy-chairs, and coal
fires&mdash;one's soul is under a curse, and can preach no
truth while one is in bondage to the flesh in this way;
but, alas! habit is the purgatory in which we suffer for
our past sins. I hear much music. We have a reunion
of musical friends every Monday. For the rest,
I have refused <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i>, which are as stupid and unprofitable
at Geneva as in England. I save all more interesting
details, that I may have them to tell you when
I am with you. I am going now to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séance</i> on Experimental
Physics by the celebrated Professor de la
Rive. This letter will at least convince you that I am
not eaten up by wolves, as they have been fearing at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Rosehill. The English papers tell of wolves descending
from the Jura and devouring the inhabitants of the
villages, but we have been in happy ignorance of these
editors' horrors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
15th Feb.
1850.</div>

<p>If you saw the Jura to-day! The snow reveals its
forests, ravines, and precipices, and it stands in relief
against a pure blue sky. The snow is on the mountains
only, now, and one is tempted to walk all day,
particularly when one lies in bed till ten, as your exemplary
friend sometimes does. I have had no discipline,
and shall return to you more of a spoiled child
than ever. Indeed, I think I am destined to be so to
the end&mdash;one of the odious swarm of voracious caterpillars
soon to be swept away from the earth by a tempest.
I am getting better bodily. I have much less
headache, but the least excitement fatigues me. Certainly,
if one cannot have a malady to carry one off
rapidly, the only sensible thing is to get well and fat;
and I believe I shall be driven to that alternative.
You know that George Sand writes for the theatre?
Her "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">François le Champi&mdash;une Comédie</span>," is simplicity
and purity itself. The seven devils are cast out.
We are going to have more acting here on Wednesday.
M. Chamel's talent makes maman's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i> quite
brilliant. You will be amused to hear that I am sitting
for my portrait&mdash;at M. d'Albert's request, not
mine. If it turns out well, I shall long to steal it to
give to you; but M. d'Albert talks of painting a second,
and in that case I shall certainly beg one. The
idea of making a study of my visage is droll enough.
I have the kindest possible letters from my brother
and sisters, promising me the warmest welcome. This
helps to give me courage for the journey; but the
strongest magnet of all is a certain little group of three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
persons whom I hope to find together at Rosehill.
Something has been said of M. d'Albert accompanying
me to Paris. I am saddened when I think of all the
horrible anxieties of trade. If I had children, I would
make them carpenters and shoemakers; that is the
way to make them Messiahs and Jacob Boehms. As
for us, who are dependent on carpets and easy-chairs,
we are reprobates, and shall never enter into the kingdom
of heaven. I go to the Genevese churches every
Sunday, and nourish my heterodoxy with orthodox
sermons. However, there are some clever men here
in the Church, and I am fortunate in being here at a
time when the very cleverest is giving a series of conferences.
I think I have never told you that we have
a long German lad of seventeen in the house&mdash;the most
taciturn and awkward of lads. He said very naïvely,
when I reproached him for not talking to a German
young lady at a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</i>, when he was seated next her at
table&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne savais que faire de mes jambes</span>." They
had placed the poor <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</i> against one of those card-tables&mdash;all
legs, like himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>The weather is so glorious that I think I may set
out on my journey soon after the 15th. I am not
quite certain yet that M. d'Albert will not be able to
accompany me to Paris; in any case, a package of so
little value will get along safely enough. I am so excited
at the idea of the time being so near when I am
to leave Geneva&mdash;a real grief&mdash;and see my friends in
England&mdash;a perfectly overwhelming joy&mdash;that I can
do nothing. I am frightened to think what an idle
wretch I am become. And you all do not write me

one any more!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<blockquote><p>M. d'Albert and his charge left Geneva towards
the end of March, and as the railway was not yet
opened all the way to France, they had to cross
the Jura in sledges, and suffered terribly from the
cold. They joined the railway at Tonnerre, and
came through Paris, arriving in England on the
23d of March. After a day in London, Miss Evans
went straight to her friends at Rosehill, where she
stayed for a few days before going on to Griff. It
will have been seen that she had set her hopes high
on the delights of home-coming, and with her too
sensitive, impressionable nature, it is not difficult
to understand, without attributing blame to any
one, that she was pretty sure to be laying up disappointment
for herself. All who have had the
experience of returning from a bright, sunny climate
to England in March will recognize in the next letters
the actual presence of the east wind, the leaden
sky, the gritty dust, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le spleen</i>.</p></blockquote>

that I have placed myself irretrievably out of reach of

the dismal weather and the dismal country and the
dismal people. It was some envious demon that drove
me across the Jura. However, I am determined to
sell everything I possess, except a portmanteau and

and a foreigner on the earth for evermore. But I

<blockquote><p>On the 4th of May Miss Evans went to Rosehill,
and on the 7th M. d'Albert joined the party for a
three days' visit. The strong affection existing between
Mr. and Mrs. Bray and their guest, and the
more congenial intellectual atmosphere surrounding
them, led Miss Evans to make her home practically
at Rosehill for the next sixteen months.
She stayed there continuously till the 18th November,
and, among other things, wrote a review of
Mackay's "Progress of the Intellect." In October
Mr. Mackay and Mr. Chapman, the editor of the
<cite>Westminster Review</cite>, came to stay at Rosehill, and
there was probably some talk then about her assisting
in the editorial work of the <cite>Review</cite>, but it
was not until the following spring that any definite
understanding on this subject was arrived at.
Meantime the article on Mackay's "Progress of
the Intellect" came out in the January, 1851, number
of the <cite>Westminster</cite>. It contains the following
remarkable passages:</p></blockquote>

<p>"Our civilization, and yet more, our religion, are an
anomalous blending of lifeless barbarisms, which have
descended to us like so many petrifactions from distant
ages, with living ideas, the offspring of a true process
of development. We are in bondage to terms
and conceptions, which, having had their roots in conditions
of thought no longer existing, have ceased to
possess any vitality, and are for us as spells which have
lost their virtue. The endeavor to spread enlightened
ideas is perpetually counteracted by these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">idola theatri</i>,
which have allied themselves, on the one hand, with
men's better sentiments, and, on the other, with institutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in whose defence are arrayed the passions and
the interests of dominant classes. Now, although the
teaching of positive truth is the grand means of expelling
error, the process will be very much quickened
if the negative argument serve as its pioneer; if, by a
survey of the past, it can be shown how each age and
each race has had a faith and a symbolism suited to
its need and its stage of development, and that for succeeding
ages to dream of retaining the spirit, along
with the forms, of the past, is as futile as the embalming
of the dead body in the hope that it may one day
be resumed by the living soul.... It is Mr. Mackay's
faith that divine revelation is not contained exclusively
or pre-eminently in the facts and inspirations of any
one age or nation, but is coextensive with the history
of human development, and is perpetually unfolding
itself to our widened experience and investigation, as
firmament upon firmament becomes visible to us in
proportion to the power and range of our exploring-instruments.
The master-key to this revelation is the
recognition of the presence of undeviating law in the
material and moral world&mdash;of that invariability of sequence
which is acknowledged to be the basis of physical
science, but which is still perversely ignored in
our social organization, our ethics, and our religion.
It is this invariability of sequence which can alone give
value to experience, and render education, in the true
sense, possible. The divine yea and nay, the seal of
prohibition and of sanction, are effectually impressed
on human deeds and aspirations, not by means of
Greek and Hebrew, but by that inexorable law of consequences
whose evidence is confirmed instead of
weakened as the ages advance; and human duty is
comprised in the earnest study of this law and patient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
obedience to its teaching. While this belief sheds a
bright beam of promise on the future career of our
race, it lights up what once seemed the dreariest region
of history with new interest; every past phase of
human development is part of that education of the
race in which we are sharing; every mistake, every absurdity,
into which poor human nature has fallen, may
be looked on as an experiment of which we may reap
the benefit. A correct generalization gives significance
to the smallest detail, just as the great inductions
of geology demonstrate in every pebble the working
of laws by which the earth has become adapted
for the habitation of man. In this view religion and
philosophy are not merely conciliated, they are identical;
or, rather, religion is the crown and consummation
of philosophy&mdash;the delicate corolla which can only
spread out its petals in all their symmetry and brilliance
to the sun when root and branch exhibit the
conditions of a healthy and vigorous life."</p>

<blockquote><p>Miss Evans seems to have been in London from
the beginning of January till the end of March,
1851; and Mr. Chapman made another fortnight's
visit to Rosehill at the end of May and beginning
of June. It was during this period that, with Miss
Evans's assistance, the prospectus of the new series
of the <cite>Westminster Review</cite> was determined on and
put in shape. At the end of July she went with Mrs.
Bray to visit Mr. and Mrs. Robert Noel, at Bishop
Steignton, in Devonshire. Mrs. Bray had some
slight illness there, and Miss Evans writes:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
5th Aug.
1851.</div>

<p>I am grieved indeed if anything might have been written,
which has not been written, to allay your anxiety
about Cara. Her letter yesterday explained what has
been the matter. I knew her own handwriting would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
be pleasanter to you than any other. I have been
talking to her this morning about the going to London
or to Rosehill. She seems to prefer London. A glance
or two at the Exposition, she thinks, would do her no
harm. To-day we are all going to Teignmouth. She
seems to like the idea of sitting by the waves. The
sun is shining gloriously, and all things are tolerably
promising. I am going to walk on before the rest and
have a bath.</p>

<blockquote><p>They went to London on the 13th of August, saw
the Crystal Palace, and returned to Rosehill on the
16th. At the end of that month, Mr. George Combe
(the distinguished phrenologist) arrived on a visit,
and he and Mrs. Combe became good friends to
Miss Evans, as will be seen from the subsequent
correspondence. They came on a second visit to
Rosehill the following month&mdash;Mr. Chapman being
also in the house at the same time&mdash;and at the
end of September Miss Evans went to stay with the
Chapmans at No. 142 Strand, as a boarder, and as
assistant editor of the <cite>Westminster Review</cite>. A new
period now opens in George Eliot's life, and emphatically
the most important period, for now she
is to be thrown in contact with Mr. Lewes, who is
to exercise so paramount an influence on all her
future, with Mr. Herbert Spencer, and with a number
of writers then representing the most fearless
and advanced thought of the day. Miss Frederica
Bremer, the authoress, was also boarding with the
Chapmans at this time, as will be seen from the
following letters:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Mr. Mackay has been very kind in coming and walking
out with me, and that is the only variety I have
had. Last night, however, we had an agreeable enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
gathering. Foxton<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
came, who, you know, is trying,
with Carlyle and others, to get a chapel for Wilson at
the West End&mdash;in which he is to figure as a seceding
clergyman. I enclose you two notes from Empson (he
is the editor of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>) as a guarantee
that I have been trying to work. Again, I proposed
to write a review of Greg for the <cite>Westminster</cite>, not for
money, but for love of the subject as connected with the
"Inquiry." Mr. Hickson referred the matter to Slack

and that the subject will not suit on this occasion, so

<p>Dr. Brabant returned to Bath yesterday. He very
politely took me to the Crystal Palace, the theatre, and
the Overland Route. On Friday we had Foxton, Wilson,
and some other nice people, among others a Mr.
Herbert Spencer, who has just brought out a large
work on "Social Statics," which Lewes pronounces the
best book he has seen on the subject. You must see
the book, if possible. Mr. Chapman is going to send
you Miss Martineau's work, or rather Mr.
Atkinson's,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
which you must review in the <cite>Herald</cite>. Whatever else
one may think of the book, it is certainly the boldest
I have seen in the English language. I get nothing
done here, there are so many <em>distractions</em>&mdash;moreover, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
have hardly been well a day since I came. I wish I
were rich enough to go to the coast, and have some
plunges in the sea to brace me. Nevertheless do not
suppose that I don't enjoy being here. I like seeing
the new people, etc., and I am afraid I shall think the
country rather dull after it. I am in a hurry to-day.
I must have two hours' work before dinner, so imagine
everything I have not said, or, rather, reflect that this
scrap is quite as much as you deserve after being so
slow to write to me.</p>

himself a wide reputation in the literary world by
his "Biographical History of Philosophy," his two
novels, "Ranthorpe," and "Rose, Blanche, and Violet"&mdash;all
of which had been published five or six
years before&mdash;and his voluminous contributions to
the periodical literature of the day. He was also, at
this time, the literary editor of the <cite>Leader</cite> newspaper,
so that any criticism of his would carry weight, and
be talked about. Much has already been written
about his extraordinary versatility, the variety of
his literary productions, his social charms, his talent
as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raconteur</i>, and his dramatic faculty; and it will
now be interesting, for those who did not know him

<p>I don't know how long Miss Bremer will stay, but you
need not wish to see her. She is to me equally unprepossessing
to eye and ear. I never saw a person
of her years who appealed less to my purely instinctive

<p>Fox is to write the article on the Suffrage, and we
are going to try Carlyle for the Peerage, Ward refusing,
on the ground that he thinks the improvement of the
physical condition of the people so all-important that
he must give all his energies to that. He says, "Life
is a bad business, but we must make the best of it;"
to which philosophy I say Amen. Dr. Hodgson is

<p>Professor Forbes is to write us a capital scientific
article, whereat I rejoice greatly. The Peerage apparently
will not "get itself done," as Carlyle says. It is
not an urgent question, nor does one see that, if the
undue influence of the Peers on the elections for the
Commons were done away with, there would be much
mischief from the House of Lords remaining for some
time longer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in statu quo</i>. I have been reading Carlyle's
"Life of Sterling" with great pleasure&mdash;not for its presentation
of Sterling, but of Carlyle. There are racy
bits of description in his best manner, and exquisite
touches of feeling. Little rapid characterizations of
living men too&mdash;of Francis Newman, for example&mdash;"a
man of fine university and other attainments, of the
sharpest cutting and most restlessly advancing intellect,
and of the mildest pious enthusiasm." There is
an inimitable description of Coleridge and his eternal
monologue&mdash;"To sit as a passive bucket and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
pumped into, whether one like it or not, can in the end
be exhilarating to no creature."</p>

<p>All the world is doing its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">devoir</i> to the great little
authoress (Miss Bremer). I went to the exhibition on
Saturday to hear the final "God save the Queen" and
the three times three&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'êtait un beau moment.</span>"
Mr. Greg thought the review "well done, and in a
kindly spirit," but thought there was not much in it&mdash;dreadfully
true, since there was only all his book. I
think he did not like the apology for his want of theological
learning, which, however, was just the thing
most needed, for the <cite>Eclectic</cite> trips him up on that score.
Carlyle was very amusing the other morning to Mr.
Chapman about the Exhibition. He has no patience
with the prince and "that Cole" assembling Sawneys
from all parts of the land, till you can't get along Piccadilly.
He has been worn to death with bores all
summer, who present themselves by twos and threes in
his study, saying, "Here we are," etc., etc.</p>

<p>I wish you could see Miss Bremer's albums, full of

A portrait of Emerson, marvellously like; one of Jenny
Lind, etc. Last night we had quite a charming <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</i>&mdash;Sir
David Brewster and his daughter; Mackay, author
of a work on popular education you may remember to
have seen reviewed in the <cite>Leader</cite>; the Ellises, the
Hodgsons, and half a dozen other nice people. Miss
Bremer was more genial than I have seen her&mdash;played
on the piano, and smiled benevolently. Altogether, I
am beginning to repent of my repugnance. Mackay
approves our prospectus <i>in toto</i>. He is a handsome,
fine-headed man, and a "good opinion." We are getting
out a circular to accompany the prospectus. I
have been kept down-stairs by Mr. Mackay for the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
two hours, and am hurried, but it was a necessity to
write <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ein paar Worte</i> to you. Mr. Mackay has written
an account of his book for the catalogue. I have been
using my powers of eloquence and flattery this morning
to make him begin an article on the "Development of
Protestantism." Mr. Ellis was agreeable&mdash;really witty.
He and Mrs. Ellis particularly cordial to me, inviting
me to visit them without ceremony. I love you all better
every day, and better the more I see of other people.

<p>I must tell you a story Miss Bremer got from Emerson.
Carlyle was very angry with him for not believing
in a devil, and to convert him took him amongst all
the horrors of London&mdash;the gin-shops, etc.&mdash;and finally
to the House of Commons, plying him at every turn
with the question, "Do you believe in a devil noo?"
There is a severe attack on Carlyle's "Life of Sterling"
in yesterday's <cite>Times</cite>&mdash;unfair as an account of the
book, but with some truth in its general remarks about
Carlyle. There is an article, evidently by James Martineau,
in the <cite>Prospective</cite>, which you must read, "On
the Unity of the Logical and Intuitive in the Ultimate
Grounds of Religious Belief." I am reading with
great amusement (!) J. H. Newman's "Lectures on the
Position of Catholics." They are full of clever satire
and description. My table is groaning with books, and
I have done very little with them yet, but I trust in my
star, which has hitherto helped me, to do all I have engaged
to do. Pray remember to send the MS. translation
of Schleiermacher's little book, and also the
book itself.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon came Mr. Spencer to ask
Mr. Chapman and me to go to the theatre; so I ended
the day in a godless manner, seeing the "Merry Wives
of Windsor." You must read Carlyle's denunciation
of the opera, published in the <cite>Keepsake</cite>! The <cite>Examiner</cite>
quotes it at length. I send you the enclosed
from Harriet Martineau. Please to return it. The one
from Carlyle you may keep till I come. He is a

saying, "We shall see," about himself. In other respects
we have been stagnating since Monday, and

<p>Harriet Martineau called on Monday morning with
Mr. Atkinson. Very kind and cordial. I honor her
for her powers and industry, and should be glad to
think highly of her. I have no doubt that she is fascinating
when there is time for talk. We have had two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
agreeable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i>. Last Monday I was talking and
listening for two hours to Pierre Leroux&mdash;a dreamy
genius. He was expounding to me his ideas. He belongs
neither to the school of Proudhon, which represents
Liberty only&mdash;nor to that of Louis Blanc, which
represents Equality only&mdash;nor to that of Cabet, which
represents Fraternity. Pierre Leroux's system is the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">synthèse</i> which combines all three. He has found the
true <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pont</i> which is to unite the love of self with love
of one's neighbor. He is, you know, a very voluminous
writer. George Sand has dedicated some of her
books to him. He dilated on his views of the "Origin
of Christianity." Strauss deficient, because he has
not shown the <i>identity of the teaching of Jesus with that
of the Essenes</i>. This is Leroux's favorite idea. I told
him of your brother. He, moreover, traces Essenism
back to Egypt, and thence to India&mdash;the cradle of all
religions, etc., etc., with much more, which he uttered
with an unction rather amusing in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée tête-à-tête</i>.
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Est ce que nous sommes faits pour chercher le bonheur?
Est ce là votre idée&mdash;dites moi." "Mais non&mdash;nous
sommes faits, je pense, pour nous développer le
plus possible." "Ah! c'est ça.</span>" He is in utter poverty,
going to lecture&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">autrement il faut mourir</i>. Has
a wife and children with him. He came to London in
his early days, when he was twenty-five, to find work
as a printer. All the world was in mourning for the
Princess Charlotte. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et moi, je me trouvais avoir <i>un
habit vert-pomme</i>.</span>" So he got no work; went back to
Paris; by hook or by crook founded the <cite>Globe</cite> journal;
knew St. Simon; disagrees with him entirely, as with
all other theorists except Pierre Leroux.</p>

<p>We are trying Mazzini to write on "Freedom <i>v.</i>
Despotism," and have received an admirable article
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
on "The New Puritanism,"<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>

Your silence did not surprise me, after the account you

have wished for you on Monday evenings. Your cordial
assurance that you shall be glad to see me sometimes
is one of those pleasant things&mdash;those life-preservers&mdash;which
relenting destiny sends me now and
then to buoy me up. For you must know that I am
not a little desponding now and then, and think that
old friends will die off, while I shall be left without the
power to make new ones. You know how sad one
feels when a great procession has swept by one, and the
last notes of its music have died away, leaving one
alone with the fields and sky. I feel so about life
sometimes. It is a help to read such a life as Margaret
Fuller's. How inexpressibly touching that passage
from her journal&mdash;"I shall always reign through the
intellect, but the life! the life! O my God! shall that
never be sweet?" I am thankful, as if for myself, that
it was sweet at last. But I am running on about feelings

its ever being weakened by a momentary irritation is
too contemptibly absurd for me to take the trouble to

that, if I did not heartily love you, I should
feel deep gratitude&mdash;but love excludes gratitude. It
is impossible that I should ever love two women better

that I can never love any so well; and it is certain

<p>Grote is very friendly, and has propitiated J. S. Mill,
who will write for us when we want him. We had
quite a brilliant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</i> yesterday evening. W. R. Greg,
Forster (of Rawdon), Francis Newman, the Ellises,
and Louis Blanc, were the stars of greatest magnitude.
I had a pleasant talk with Greg and Forster. Greg
was "much pleased to have made my acquaintance."
Forster, on the whole, appeared to think that people
should be glad to make <em>his</em> acquaintance. Greg is a
short man, but his brain is large, the anterior lobe very
fine, and a moral region to correspond. Black, wiry,
curly hair, and every indication of a first-rate temperament.
We have some very nice Americans here&mdash;the
Pughs&mdash;friends of the Parkes's, really refined, intellectual
people. Miss Pugh, an elderly lady, is a
great abolitionist, and was one of the Women's Convention
that came to England in 1840, and was not
allowed to join the Men's Convention. But I suppose
we shall soon be able to say, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nous avons changé tout
cela</i>.</p>

<p>I went to the opera on Saturday&mdash;"I Martiri," at
Covent Garden&mdash;with my "excellent friend, Herbert
Spencer," as Lewes calls him. We have agreed that
we are not in love with each other, and that there is no
reason why we should not have as much of each other's
society as we like. He is a good, delightful creature,
and I always feel better for being with him.</p>

<p>I like to remind you of me on Sunday morning,
when you look at the flowers and listen to music; so
I send a few lines, though I have not much time to
spare to-day. After Tuesday I will write you a longer
letter, and tell you all about everything. I am going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to the opera to-night to hear the "Huguenots." See
what a fine thing it is to pick up people who are short-sighted
enough to like one.</p>

<blockquote><p>On the 4th of May a meeting, consisting chiefly
of authors, was held at the house in the Strand, for
the purpose of hastening the removal of the trade
restrictions on the Commerce of Literature, and it
is thus described in the following letter:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
5th May,
1852.</div>

<p>The meeting last night went off triumphantly, and
I saluted Mr. Chapman with "See the Conquering
Hero Comes" on the piano at 12 o'clock; for not until
then was the last magnate, except Herbert Spencer,
out of the house. I sat at the door for a short time,
but soon got a chair within it, and heard and saw
everything.</p>

<p>Dickens in the chair&mdash;a position he fills remarkably
well, preserving a courteous neutrality of eyebrows,
and speaking with clearness and decision. His appearance
is certainly disappointing&mdash;no benevolence
in the face, and, I think, little in the head; the anterior
lobe not by any means remarkable. In fact, he is
not distinguished-looking in any way&mdash;neither handsome
nor ugly, neither fat nor thin, neither tall nor
short. Babbage moved the first resolution&mdash;a bad
speaker, but a great authority. Charles Knight is a
beautiful, elderly man, with a modest but firm enunciation;
and he made a wise and telling speech which
silenced one or two vulgar, ignorant booksellers who
had got into the meeting by mistake. One of these
began by complimenting Dickens&mdash;"views held by
such worthy and important gentlemen, <i>which is your
worthy person in the chair</i>." Dickens looked respectfully
neutral. The most telling speech of the evening
was Prof. Tom Taylor's&mdash;as witty and brilliant as one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of George Dawson's. Prof. Owen's, too, was remarkably
good. He had a resolution to move as to
the bad effect of the trade restrictions on scientific
works, and gave his own experience in illustration.
Speaking of the slow and small sale of scientific books
of a high class, he said, in his silvery, bland way&mdash;alluding
to the boast that the retail booksellers <em>recommended</em>
the works of less known authors&mdash;"for which
limited sale we are doubtless indebted to the kind recommendation
of our friends, the retail booksellers"&mdash;whereupon
these worthies, taking it for a <i>bonâ fide</i>
compliment, cheered enthusiastically. Dr. Lankester,
Prof. Newman, Robert Bell, and others, spoke well.
Owen has a tremendous head, and looked, as he was,
the greatest celebrity of the meeting. George Cruikshank,
too, made a capital speech, in an admirable
moral spirit. He is the most homely, genuine-looking
man; not unlike the pictures of Captain Cuttle.</p>

<p>I went to hear the "Huguenots" on Saturday evening.
It was a rich treat. Mario and Grisi and Formes,
and that finest of orchestras under Costa. I am going
to a concert to-night. This is all very fine, but, in the
meantime, I am getting as haggard as an old witch under
London atmosphere and influences. I shall be
glad to have sent me my Shakespeare, Goethe, Byron,
and Wordsworth, if you will be so good as to take the
trouble of packing them.</p>

<p>My days have slipped away in a most mysterious
fashion lately&mdash;chiefly, I suppose, in long walks and
long talks. Our Monday evenings are dying off&mdash;not
universally regretted&mdash;but we are expecting one or two
people to-night. I have nothing to tell except that I
went to the opera on Thursday, and heard "La Juive,"
and, moreover, fell in love with Prince Albert, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
unusually animated and prominent. He has a noble,
genial, intelligent expression, and is altogether a man
to be proud of. I am going next Thursday to see
Grisi in "Norma." She is quite beautiful this season,
thinner than she was, and really younger looking.</p>

<p>My brightest spot, next to my love of <em>old</em> friends, is
the deliciously calm, <em>new</em> friendship that Herbert Spencer
gives me. We see each other every day, and have
delightful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</i> in everything. But for him
my life would be desolate enough. What a wretched
lot of old, shrivelled creatures we shall be by and by.
Never mind, the uglier we get in the eyes of others the
lovelier we shall be to each other; that has always
been my firm faith about friendship, and now it is in a
slight degree my experience. Mme. d'Albert has sent
me the sweetest letter, just like herself; and I feel
grateful to have such a heart remembering and loving
me on the other side of the Jura. They are very well
and flourishing.</p>

<p>I am bothered to death with article-reading and
scrap-work of all sorts: it is clear my poor head will
never produce anything under these circumstances;
<em>but I am patient</em>. I am ashamed to tease you so, but
I must beg of you to send me George Sand's works;
and also I shall be grateful if you will lend me&mdash;what I
think you have&mdash;an English edition of "Corinne," and
Miss Austen's "Sense and Sensibility." Harriet Martineau's
article on "Niebuhr" will not go in the July
number. I am sorry for it; it is admirable. After
all, she is a <em>trump</em>&mdash;the only Englishwoman that possesses
thoroughly the art of writing.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning I went to St. Paul's to see
the charity children assembled, and hear their singing.
Berlioz says it is the finest thing he has heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in England; and this opinion of his induced me to go.
I was not disappointed; it is worth doing once, especially
as we got out before the sermon. I had a long
call from George Combe yesterday. He says he thinks
the <cite>Westminster</cite>, under <em>my</em> management, the most important
means of enlightenment of a literary nature in
existence; the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>, under Jeffrey, nothing to it,
etc.!!! I wish <em>I</em> thought so too.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Brays,
21st June,

<p>Your joint assurance of welcome strengthens the
centripetal force that would carry me to you; but, on
the other hand, sundry considerations are in favor of
the centrifugal force, which, I suppose, will carry me
to Broadstairs or Ramsgate. On the whole, I prefer
to keep my visit to you as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne-bouche</i>, when I am
just in the best physical and mental state for enjoying
it. I hope to get away on Saturday, or on Wednesday
at the latest. I think the third number of the <cite>Review</cite>
will be capital; thoroughly readable, and yet not
frothy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I have assured Herbert Spencer that you will think
it a sufficiently formal answer to the invitation you
sent him through Mr. Lewes, if I tell you that he will
prefer waiting for the pleasure of a visit to you until I
am with you&mdash;if you will have him then. I spent the
evening at Mr. Parkes's on Monday. Yesterday Herbert
Spencer brought his father to see me&mdash;a large-brained,
highly informed man, with a certain quaintness
and simplicity, altogether very pleasing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>After all, I begin to hope that our next number will
be the best yet. Forbes is good; Froude ditto; and
James Martineau, if I may judge from a glance at a
few of his pages, admirable. Lewes has written us an
agreeable article on "Lady Novelists." There is a
mysterious contribution to the independent section.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
We are hoping that an article on "Edinburgh Literary
Men," yet to come, will be very good. If not, we shall
put in "Niebuhr;" it is capital.</p>

<p>The opera, Chiswick Flower Show, the French play,
and the Lyceum, all in one week, brought their natural
consequences of headache and hysterics&mdash;all yesterday.
At five o'clock I felt quite sure that life was unendurable.
This morning, however, the weather and
I are both better, having cried ourselves out and used
up all our clouds; and I can even contemplate living
six months longer. Was there ever anything more
dreary than this June?</p>

<p>I am busy packing to-day, and am going to Mr.
Parkes's to dinner. Miss Parkes has introduced me
to Barbara Smith,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
whose expression I like exceedingly,
and hope to know more of her. I go to Broadstairs
on Saturday. I am sadly in want of the change, and
would much rather present myself to you all when I
can do you more credit as a friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Bray,
4th July,
1852.</div>

<p>I warn you against Ramsgate, which is a strip of
London come out for an airing. Broadstairs is perfect;
and I have the snuggest little lodging conceivable,
with a motherly good woman and a nice little damsel
of fourteen to wait on me. There are only my two
rooms in this cottage, but lodgings are plentiful in the
place. I have a sitting-room about eight feet by nine,
and a bedroom a little larger; yet in that small space
there is almost every comfort. I pay a guinea a week
for my rooms, so I shall not ruin myself by staying a
month, unless I commit excesses in coffee and sugar.
I am thinking whether it would not be wise to retire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
from the world and live here for the rest of my days.
With some fresh paper on the walls, and an easy-chair,
I think I could resign myself. Come and tell me your
opinion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I thought of you last night, when I was in a state of
mingled rapture and torture&mdash;rapture at the sight of a
glorious evening sky, torture at the sight and hearing
of the belaboring given to the poor donkey which was
drawing me from Ramsgate home.</p>

<p>I had a note from Miss Florence Nightingale yesterday.
I was much pleased with her. There is a
loftiness of mind about her which is well expressed by
her form and manner. Glad you are pleased with the
<cite>Westminster</cite>. I do think it a rich number&mdash;matter for
a fortnight's reading and thought. Lewes has not half
done it justice in the <cite>Leader</cite>. To my mind the "Niebuhr"
article is as good as any of them. If you could
see me in my quiet nook! I am half ashamed of being
in such clover, both spiritually and materially, while
some of my friends are on the dusty highways, without
a tuft of grass or a flower to cheer them. A letter
from you will be delightful. We seem to have said
very little to each other lately. But I always know&mdash;rejoice
to know&mdash;that there is the same Sara for me
as there is the same green earth and arched sky,
when I am good and wise enough to like the best
thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Charles
Bray, 21st
July, 1852.</div>

<p>Do not be anxious about me&mdash;there is no cause. I
am profiting, body and mind, from quiet walks and
talks with nature, gathering "lady's bedstraw" and
"rest-harrow," and other pretty things; picking up
shells (not in the Newtonian sense, but literally); reading
Aristotle, to find out what is the chief good; and
eating mutton-chops, that I may have strength to pursue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
it. If you insist on my writing about "emotions,"
why, I must get some up expressly for the purpose.
But I must own I would rather not, for it is the grand
wish and object of my life to get rid of them as far as
possible, seeing they have already had more than their
share of my nervous energy. I shall not be in town on
the 2d of August&mdash;at least, I pray Heaven to forbid it.</p>

<p>Are you really the better for having been here? Since
you left I have been continually regretting that I could
not make your visit pleasanter. I was irritable and
out of sorts; but you have an apparatus for secreting
happiness&mdash;that's it. Providence, seeing that I wanted
weaning from this place, has sent a swarm of harvest-bugs
and lady-birds. These, with the half-blank, half-dissipated
feeling which comes on after having companions
and losing them, make me think of returning
to London on Saturday week with more resignation
than I have felt before. I am very well and "plucky"&mdash;a
word which I propose to substitute for happy, as
more truthful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>For the last two months I have been at this pretty,
quiet place, which "David Copperfield" has made
classic, far away from London noise and smoke.</p>

<p>I am sorry now that I brought with me Fox's "Lectures,"
which I had not managed to read before I left
town. But I shall return thither at the end of next
week, and I will at once forward the volume to Gary
Lane.</p>

<p>One sees no novels less than a year old at the sea-side,
so I am unacquainted with the "Blithedale Romance,"
except through the reviews, which have whetted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
my curiosity more than usual. Hawthorne is a grand
favorite of mine, and I shall be sorry if he do not go
on surpassing himself. It is sad to hear of your only
going out to consult a physician. Illness seems to me
the one woe for which there is no comfort&mdash;no compensation.
But perhaps you find it otherwise, for you
have a less rebellious spirit than I, and suffering seems
to make you look all the more gentle.</p>

<p>Thinking of you this morning&mdash;as I often do, though
you may not suppose so&mdash;it was "borne in on my
mind" that I must write to you, and I obey the inspiration
without waiting to consider whether there
may be a corresponding desire on your part to hear
from me. I live in a world of cares and joys so remote
from the one in which we used to sympathize
with each other that I find positive communication
with you difficult. But I am not unfaithful to old loves&mdash;they
were sincere, and they are lasting. I hope you
will not think it too much trouble to write me a little
news of yourself. I want very much to know if your
health continues good, and if there has been any change
in your circumstances, that I may have something like
a true conception of you. All is well with me so far
as my individuality is concerned, but I have plenty of
friends' troubles to sorrow over. I hope you have none
to add to the number.</p>

not yet gone, and of course I am in the worst spirits,
and my opinion of things is not worth a straw. I tell
you this that you may know why I only send you this

<p>Somehow my letters&mdash;except those which come under
the inexorable imperative <em>must</em> (the "ought" I
manage well enough to shirk)&mdash;will not get written.
The fact is, I am in a croaking mood, and I am waiting
and waiting for it to pass by, so if my pen croaks
in spite of my resolutions to the contrary, please to
take no notice of it. Ever since I came back I have
felt something like the madness which imagines that
the four walls are contracting and going to crush one.
Harriet Martineau (in a private letter shown to me),
with incomprehensible ignorance, jeers at Lewes for
introducing <em>psychology</em> as a science in his Comte papers.
Why, Comte himself holds psychology to be a necessary
link in the chain of science. Lewes only suggests
a change in its relations. There is a great, dreary
article on the Colonies by my side, asking for reading
and abridgment, so I cannot go on scribbling&mdash;indeed,
my hands are so hot and tremulous this morning that
it will be better for you if I leave off. Your little loving
notes are very precious to me; but I say nothing
about matters of feeling till my good genius has returned

just now.</p>

<p>The week has really yielded nothing worth telling
you. I am a few degrees more wizened and muddle-headed;
and the articles for the <cite>Review</cite> are, on the
whole, unsatisfactory. I fear a discerning public will
think this number a sad falling-off. This is the greater
pity, that said public is patronizing us well at present.
Scarcely a day passes that some one does not write to
order the <cite>Review</cite>, as a permanent subscriber. You may
as well expect news from an old spider or bat as from
me. I can only tell you what I think of the "Blithedale
Romance," of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and the American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Fishery Dispute&mdash;all which, I am very sure, you don't
want to know. Do have pity on me, and make a little
variety in my life, by all sending me a scrap&mdash;never
mind if it be only six lines apiece. Perhaps something
will befall me one day or other. As it is, nothing
happens to me but the ringing of the dinner-bell and
the arrival of a proof. I have no courage to walk out.</p>

<p>Lewes called on me the other day and told me of a
conversation with Professor Owen, in which the latter
declared his conviction that the cerebrum was not the
organ of the mind, but the cerebellum rather. He
founds on the enormous comparative size of brain in
the grampus! The professor has a huge anterior lobe
of his own. What would George Combe say if I were
to tell him? But every great man has his paradox,

startling one.</p>

<p>We shall make a respectable figure after all&mdash;nine

bad. The <cite>Review</cite> has been selling well lately, in spite
of its being the end of the quarter. We have made
splendid provision for January&mdash;Froude, Harriet Martineau,
Theodore Parker, Samuel Brown, etc., etc. The

<p>Pity me&mdash;I have had the headache for four days incessantly.
But now I am well, and even the Strand
seems an elysium by contrast. I set off on Tuesday
for Edinburgh by express. This is awfully expensive,
but it seems the only way of reaching there alive with
my frail body. I have had the kindest notes from the
Combes and from Harriet Martineau.

<p>Here I am in this beautiful Auld Reekie once more&mdash;hardly
recognizing myself for the same person as the
<i>damozel</i> who left it by the coach with a heavy heart
some six years ago. The Combes are all kindness,
and I am in clover&mdash;an elegant house, glorious fires,
and a comfortable carriage&mdash;in short, just in the circumstances
to nourish sleek optimism, convince one
that this is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le meilleur des mondes possibles</i>, and make one
shudder at the impiety of all who doubt it. Last evening
Mr. Robert Cox came to tea, to be introduced to
me as my <i>cicerone</i> through the lions of Edinburgh. The
talk last night was pleasant enough, though, of course,
all the interlocutors besides Mr. Combe have little to
do but shape elegant modes of negation and affirmation,
like the people who are talked to by Socrates in
Plato's dialogues&mdash;"Certainly," "that I firmly believe,"
etc. I have a beautiful view from my room window&mdash;masses
of wood, distant hills, the Firth, and four splendid
buildings, clotted far apart&mdash;not an ugly object to
be seen. When I look out in the morning, it is as if I
had waked up in Utopia or Icaria, or one of Owen's
parallelograms. The weather is perfect&mdash;all the more
delightful to me for its northern sharpness, which is
just what I wanted to brace me. I have been out
walking and driving all day, and have only time before
dinner to send this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paar Worte</i>, but I may have still
less time to-morrow.</p>

<p>Between the beauty of the weather and the scenery,
and the kindness of good people, I am tipsy with pleasure.
But I shall tell you nothing of what I see and
do, because that would be taking off some of the edge
from your pleasure in seeing me. One's dear friend
who has nothing at all to tell one is a bore. Is it not
so, honor bright? I enjoy talking to Mr. Combe; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
can tell me many things, especially about men in America
and elsewhere, which are valuable; and, besides,
I sometimes manage to get in more than a negative or
affirmative. He and Mrs. Combe are really affectionate
to me, and the mild warmth of their regard, with
the perfect order and elegance of everything about
me, are just the soothing influence to do me good.
They urge me to stay longer, but I shall adhere to my
original determination of going to Miss Martineau's
on the 20th, and I do not <em>mean</em> to stay with her longer
than the 25th. We are going to-day to Craigcrook
(Jeffrey's place), a beautiful spot, which old October

<p>Yes, he is an apostle. An apostle, it is true, with a
back and front drawing-room, but still earnest, convinced,
consistent, having fought a good fight, and now
peacefully enjoying the retrospect of it. I shall leave
these good friends with regret, almost with repentings,
that I did not determine to pay them a longer visit.
I have had a pleasant note from Miss Martineau this
morning, with a vignette of her house&mdash;I suppose to
make me like all the better the idea of going there.</p>

<p>The coach brought me to Miss Martineau's gate at
half-past six yesterday evening, and she was there, with
a beaming face, to welcome me. Mr. Atkinson joined
us this morning, and is a very agreeable addition.
There has been an intelligent gentleman visitor to-day,

cottages and enjoying the sight of the mountains, spite
of the rain and mist. The weather is not promising, that
is the worst of it. Miss M. is charming in her own
home&mdash;quite handsome from her animation and intelligence.
She came behind me, put her hands round
me, and kissed me in the prettiest way this evening,
telling me she was so glad she had got me here. I
send you her note that you may have an idea of "The
Knoll."</p>

<p>We had a fine day yesterday, and went to Borrowdale.
I have not been well since I have been here.
Still I manage to enjoy, certainly not myself, but my
companions and the scenery. I shall set off from here
on Tuesday morning, and shall be due at the Coventry
station, I believe, at 5.50.</p>

<p>To get into a first-class carriage, fall asleep, and awake
to find one's self where one would be, is almost as good
as having Prince Hussein's carpet. This was my easy
way of getting to London on Thursday. By 5 o'clock
I had unpacked my boxes and made my room tidy,
and then I began to feel some satisfaction in being
settled down where I am of most use just now. After
dinner came Herbert Spencer, and spent the evening.
Yesterday morning Mr. Greg called on his way to
Paris, to express his regret that he did not see me at
Ambleside. He is very pleasing, but somehow or other
he frightens me dreadfully. I am going to plunge into
Thackeray's novel now ("Esmond").</p>

<p>Oh, this hideous fog! Let me grumble, for I have
had headache the last three days, and there seems little
prospect of anything else in such an atmosphere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
I am ready to vow that I will not live in the Strand
again after Christmas. If I were not choked by the
fog, the time would trot pleasantly withal, but of what
use are brains and friends when one lives in a light
such as might be got in the chimney? "Esmond" is
the most uncomfortable book you can imagine. You
remember how you disliked "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">François le Champi</span>."
Well, the story of "Esmond" is just the same. The
hero is in love with the daughter all through the book,
and marries the mother at the end. You should read
the debates on the opening of Parliament in the <cite>Times</cite>.
Lord Brougham, the greatest of English orators, perpetrates
the most delicious <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non sequitur</i> I have seen
for a long time. "My Lords, I believe that any disturbance

<p>I perceive your reading of the golden rule is "Do
as you are done by;" and I shall be wiser than to expect
a letter from you another Monday morning, when
I have not earned it by my Saturday's billet. The fact
is, both callers and work thicken&mdash;the former sadly
interfering with the latter. I will just tell you how it
was last Saturday, and that will give you an idea of
my days. My task was to read an article of Greg's in
the <cite>North British</cite> on "Taxation," a heap of newspaper
articles, and all that J. S. Mill says on the same subject.
When I had got some way into this <i>magnum
mare</i>, in comes Mr. Chapman, with a thick German
volume. "Will you read enough of this to give me
your opinion of it?" Then of course I must have a
walk after lunch, and when I had sat down again,
thinking that I had two clear hours before dinner, rap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
at the door&mdash;Mr. Lewes, who, of course, sits talking
till the second bell rings. After dinner another visitor,
and so behold me, at 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, still very far at sea
on the subject of Taxation, but too tired to keep my
eyes open. We had Bryant the poet last evening&mdash;a
pleasant, quiet, elderly man. Do you know of this
second sample of plagiarism by D'Israeli, detected by
the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>?<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
It is worth sending for its
cool impudence. Write me some news about trade, at
all events. I could tolerate even Louis Napoleon, if
somehow or other he could have a favorable influence
on the Coventry trade.</p>

<p>Another week almost "with the years beyond the
flood." What has it brought you? To me it has
brought articles to read&mdash;for the most part satisfactory&mdash;new
callers, and letters to nibble at my time,
and a meeting of the Association for the Abolition of
Taxes on Knowledge. I am invited to go to the Leigh
Smiths on Monday evening to meet Mr. Robert Noel.
Herbert Spencer is invited, too, because Mr. Noel
wants especially to see him. Barbara Smith speaks
of Mr. R. Noel as their "dear German friend." So the
Budget is come out, and I am to pay income-tax. All
very right, of course. An enlightened personage like
me has no "ignorant impatience of taxation." I am
glad to hear of the Lectures to Young Men and the
banquet of the Laborers' Friend Society. "Be not
weary in well-doing." Thanks to Sara for her letter.
She must not mind paying the income-tax; it is a
right principle that Dizzy is going upon; and with her
great conscientiousness she ought to enjoy being flayed
on a right principle.</p>

with myself as to what I ought to do now for

<p>Your love and goodness are a comforting presence
to me everywhere, whether I am ninety or only nine
miles away from you. Chrissey bears her trouble much
better than I expected. We hope that an advantageous
arrangement may be made about the practice;
and there is a considerable sum in debts to be collected.
I shall return to town on Wednesday. It
would have been a comfort to see you again before
going back, but there are many reasons for not doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>

though the dear creatures here will be a constant motive
for work and economy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I arrived here only yesterday. I had agreed with

to return to town; that I could do her no substantial
good by staying another week, while I should be losing

<p>I am out of spirits about the <cite>Review</cite>. I should
be glad to run away from it altogether. But one thing
is clear, that it would be a great deal worse if I were
not here. This is the only thought that consoles me.
We are thinking of sending Chrissey's eldest boy to
Australia. A patient of his father's has offered to
place him under suitable protection at Adelaide, and I
strongly recommend Chrissey to accept her offer&mdash;that
is, if she will let it be available a year hence; so I have
bought Sidney's book on Australia, and am going to
send it to Chrissey, to enlighten her about matters
there, and accustom her mind to the subject. You are
"jolly," I dare say, as good people have a right to be.

may rejoice in your joy, having none of my own.</p>

<p>My complaint, of which I am now happily rid, was
rheumatism in the right arm; a sufficient reason, you
will see, for my employing a scribe to write that promise
which I now fulfil. I am going into the country,
perhaps for a fortnight, so that, if you are kind enough
to come here on Wednesday evening, I shall not have
the pleasure of seeing you. All the more reason for
writing to you, in spite of cold feet and the vilest pens
in the world.</p>

<p>Francis Newman is likely to come once or twice in
the season; not more. He has, of course, a multitude
of engagements, and many more attractive ones than a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</i> in the Strand.</p>

<p>Never mention me to him in the character of editress.
I think&mdash;at least, I am told&mdash;that he has no high
estimate of woman's powers and functions. But let
that pass. He is a very pure, noble being, and it is
good only to look at such.</p>

<p>The article on "Slavery," in the last number of the
<cite>Westminster</cite>&mdash;which I think the best article of them
all&mdash;is by W. E. Forster, a Yorkshire manufacturer,
who married Dr. Arnold's daughter. He is a very
earnest, independent thinker, and worth a gross of literary
hacks who have the "trick" of writing.</p>

<p>I hope you are interested in the Slavery question,
and in America generally&mdash;that cradle of the future.
I used resolutely to turn away from American politics,
and declare that the United States was the last region
of the world I should care to visit. Even now I almost
loathe the <em>common</em> American type of character. But I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
am converted to a profound interest in the history, the
laws, the social and religious phases of North America,
and long for some knowledge of them.</p>

<p>Is it not cheering to think of the youthfulness of
this little planet, and the immensely greater youthfulness
of our race upon it? to think that the higher
moral tendencies of human nature are yet only in their
germ? I feel this more thoroughly when I think of
that great western continent, with its infant cities, its
huge, uncleared forests, and its unamalgamated races.</p>

<p>I dare say you have guessed that the article on "Ireland"
is Harriet Martineau's. Herbert Spencer did
<em>not</em> contribute to the last number.</p>

<p><i>À propos</i> of articles, do you see the <cite>Prospective Review</cite>?
There is an admirable critique of Kingsley's
"Phaethon" in it, by James Martineau. But perhaps
you may not be as much in love with Kingsley's genius,
and as much "riled" by his faults, as I am.</p>

<p>Of course you have read "Ruth" by this time. Its
style was a great refreshment to me, from its finish
and fulness. How women have the courage to write,
and publishers the spirit to buy, at a high price, the
false and feeble representations of life and character
that most feminine novels give, is a constant marvel
to me. "Ruth," with all its merits, will not be an
enduring or classical fiction&mdash;will it? Mrs. Gaskell
seems to me to be constantly misled by a love of sharp
contrasts&mdash;of "dramatic" effects. She is not contented
with the subdued coloring, the half-tints, of real life.
Hence she agitates one for the moment, but she does
not secure one's lasting sympathy; her scenes and
characters do not become typical. But how pretty
and graphic are the touches of description! That little
attic in the minister's house, for example, which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
with its pure white dimity bed-curtains, its bright-green
walls, and the rich brown of its stained floor, remind
one of a snowdrop springing out of the soil. Then the
rich humor of Sally, and the sly satire in the description
of Mr. Bradshaw. Mrs. Gaskell has, certainly, a
charming mind, and one cannot help loving her as one
reads her books.</p>

<p>A notable book just come out is Wharton's "Summary
of the Laws relating to Women." "Enfranchisement
of women" only makes creeping progress; and
that is best, for woman does not yet deserve a much
better lot than man gives her.</p>

<p>I am writing to you the last thing, and am so tired
that I am not quite sure whether I finish my sentences.
But your divining power will supply their
deficiencies.</p>

<p>For the first time in my experience I am positively

I could bear; but to-day the sun shines, and there is
blue above and blue below, consequently I find life
very glorious, and myself a particularly fortunate <i>diavolessa</i>.
The landlord of my lodgings is a German,
comes from Saxe-Weimar, knows well the Duchess of
Orleans, and talked to me this morning of <em>Mr.</em> Schiller
and <em>Mr.</em> Goethe. <i>À propos</i> of Goethe, there is a most
true, discriminating passage about him in the article
on Shakespeare in the <cite>Prospective</cite>. <em>Mr.</em> Goethe is one
of my companions here, and I had felt some days before
reading the passage the truth which it expresses.</p>

<blockquote><p>Subjoined is the passage from the <cite>Prospective Review</cite>
of August, 1853:</p>

<p>"Goethe's works are too much in the nature of
literary studies; the mind is often deeply impressed
by them, but one doubts if the author was. He
saw them as he saw the houses of Weimar and the
plants in the act of metamorphosis. He had a
clear perception of their fixed condition and their
successive transitions, but he did not really (at least
so it seems to us) comprehend their motive power.
In a word, he appreciated their life but not their
liveliness.... And we trace this not to a defect in
imaginative power&mdash;a defect which it would be a
simple absurdity to impute to Goethe&mdash;but to the
tone of his character and the habits of his mind.
He moved hither and thither through life, but he
was always a man apart. He mixed with unnumbered
kinds of men, with courts and academies,
students and women, camps and artists, but everywhere
he was with them, yet not of them. In every
scene he was there, and he made it clear that he
was there with a reserve and as a stranger. He
went there <em>to experience</em>. As a man of universal

<p>As for me, I am in the best health and spirits. I have
had a letter from Mr. Combe to-day, urging me to go
to Edinburgh, but I have made an engagement with
Mr. Chapman to do work which will oblige me to remain
in London. Mrs. P. is a very bonny, pleasant-looking woman,
with a smart drawing-room and liberal
opinions&mdash;in short, such a friend as self-interest, well
understood, would induce one to cultivate. I find it
difficult to meet with any lodgings at once tolerable
and cheap. My theory is to <em>live</em> entirely&mdash;that is, pay
rent and find food&mdash;out of my positive income, and
then work for as large a surplus as I can get. The
next number of the <cite>Review</cite> will be better than usual.
Froude writes on the "Book of Job"! He at first talked
of an article on the three great <em>subjective</em> poems&mdash;Job,
Faust, and Hamlet&mdash;an admirable subject&mdash;but it has

<p>I am reading "The Religion of the Heart" (Leigh
Hunt's), and am far more pleased with it than I expected
to be. I have just fallen on two passages with
which you will agree. "Parker ... is full of the poetry
of religion; Martineau equally so, with a closer
style and incessant eloquence of expression, perhaps a
perilous superabundance of it as regards the claims of
matter over manner; and his assumptions of perfection
in the character of Jesus are so reiterated and
peremptory that in a man of less evident heart and
goodness they might almost look like a very unction
of insincerity or of policy, of doubt forcing itself to
seem undoubting. Hennell's 'Christian Theism' is
one long, beautiful discourse proclaiming the great
Bible of Creation, and reconciling Pagan and Christian
Philosophy."</p>

<p>I begin this year more happily than I have done
most years of my life. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notre vraie destinée</span>," says
Comte, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">se compose de <i>resignation</i> et <i>d'activité</i></span>"&mdash;and
I seem more disposed to both than I have ever been
before. Let us hope that we shall both get stronger by
the year's activity&mdash;calmer by its resignation. I know
it may be just the contrary&mdash;don't suspect me of being
a canting optimist. We <em>may</em> both find ourselves at
the end of the year going faster to the hell of conscious
moral and intellectual weakness. Still, there
is a possibility&mdash;even a probability&mdash;the other way. I
have not seen Harriet Martineau's "Comte" yet&mdash;she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
is going to give me a copy&mdash;but Mr. Lewes tells me it

yesterday that I wished to give up my connection
with the editorship of the <cite>Westminster</cite>. He wishes me
to continue the present state of things until April. I
shall be much more satisfied on many accounts to have

and a draught is the consequence. Secondly, there is
a piano in the house which has decidedly entered on
its second childhood, and this piano is occasionally
played on by Miss P. with a really enviable <i>aplomb</i>.
Thirdly, the knocks at the door startle me&mdash;an annoyance

of enjoyment, I have been too sick and headachy

<p>In the last number of the <cite>Scotsman</cite> which I sent you
there was a report of a speech by Dr. Guthrie at the
Education meeting, containing a passage which I meant
to have copied. He is speaking of the impossibility of
teaching morality with the "Bible shut," and says that
in that case the teacher would be obliged to resort to
"congruity and the fitness of things," about which the
boy knows nothing more than that the apple is <em>fit</em> for
his mouth. What is wanted to convince the boy of his
sin is, "Thou God seest me," and "Thou bleeding
Lamb, the best morality is love of thee!" Mr. Lewes
came a few minutes after you left, and desired me to
tell you that he was sorry to miss you.</p>

and is ordered not to put pen to paper for a month;
so I have something to do for him in addition to my
own work, which is rather pressing. He is gone to
Arthur Helps, in Hampshire, for ten days, and I really
hope this total cessation from work, in obedience to a
peremptory order, will end in making him better than
he has been for the last year. No opera and no fun
for me for the next month. Happily, I shall have no

<p>It is quite possible that I may wish to go to the

on a walking excursion to Windsor to-day with his
doctor, who pronounces him better, but not yet fit for

of Dr. Whewell.</p>

<p>My troubles are purely psychical&mdash;self-dissatisfaction,
and despair of achieving anything worth the doing.
I can truly say they vanish into nothing before any fear
for the happiness of those I love. Thank you for letting
me know how things are, for indeed I could not
bear to be shut out from your anxieties. When I
spoke of myself as an island, I did not mean that I
was so exceptionally. We are all islands&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"Each in his hidden sphere of joy or woe,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>and this seclusion is sometimes the most intensely felt
at the very moment your friend is caressing you or
consoling you. But this gradually becomes a source of
satisfaction instead of repining. When we are young
we think our troubles a mighty business&mdash;that the
world is spread out expressly as a stage for the particular
drama of our lives, and that we have a right to rant
and foam at the mouth if we are crossed. I have done
enough of that in my time. But we begin at last to
understand that these things are important only to our
own consciousness, which is but as a globule of dew on
a rose-leaf, that at mid-day there will be no trace of.
This is no high-flown sentimentality, but a simple reflection,
which I find useful to me every day. I expect
to see Mr. Lewes back again to-day. His poor head&mdash;his
only fortune&mdash;is not well yet; and he has had the
misery of being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuyé</i> with idleness, without perceiving
the compensating physical improvement. Still, I hope
the good he has been getting has been greater than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
he has been conscious of. I expect "Feuerbach" will
be all in print by the end of next week, and there are

<blockquote><p>We have now been led up to the most important
event in George Eliot's life&mdash;her union with
Mr. George Henry Lewes. Here, as elsewhere, it
seems to me to be of the first importance that she
should speak for herself; and there is, fortunately,
a letter to Mrs. Bray, dated in September, 1855&mdash;fourteen
months after the event&mdash;which puts on
record the point of view from which she regarded
her own action. I give this letter here (out of its
place as to date); and I may add, what, I think, has
not been mentioned before, that not only was Mr.
Lewes's previous family life irretrievably spoiled,
but his home had been wholly broken up for nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
two years. In forming a judgment on so momentous
a question, it is, above all things, necessary to
understand what was actually undertaken, what
was actually achieved; and, in my opinion, this
can best be arrived at, not from any outside statement
or arguments, but by consideration of the
whole tenor of the life which follows, in the development
of which Mr. Lewes's true character, as
well as George Eliot's, will unfold itself. No words
that any one else can write, no arguments any one
else can use, will, I think, be so impressive as the
life itself.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Bray,
4th Sept.
1855.</div>

<p>If there is any one action or relation of my life which
is, and always has been, profoundly serious, it is my
relation to Mr. Lewes. It is, however, natural enough
that you should mistake me in many ways, for not
only are you unacquainted with Mr. Lewes's real character
and the course of his actions, but also it is several
years now since you and I were much together,
and it is possible that the modifications my mind has
undergone may be quite in the opposite direction of
what you imagine. No one can be better aware than
yourself that it is possible for two people to hold different
opinions on momentous subjects with equal sincerity,
and an equally earnest conviction that their
respective opinions are alone the truly moral ones. If
we differ on the subject of the marriage laws, I at least
can believe of you that you cleave to what you believe
to be good; and I don't know of anything in the nature
of your views that should prevent you from believing
the same of me. <em>How far</em> we differ I think we
neither of us know, for I am ignorant of your precise
views; and, apparently, you attribute to me both feelings
and opinions which are not mine. We cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
set each other quite right in this matter in letters, but
one thing I can tell you in few words. Light and easily
broken ties are what I neither desire theoretically nor
could live for practically. Women who are satisfied
with such ties do <em>not</em> act as I have done. That any
unworldly, unsuperstitious person who is sufficiently
acquainted with the realities of life can pronounce my
relation to Mr. Lewes immoral, I can only understand
by remembering how subtile and complex are the influences
that mould opinion. But I <em>do</em> remember this:
and I indulge in no arrogant or uncharitable thoughts
about those who condemn us, even though we might
have expected a somewhat different verdict. From
the majority of persons, of course, we never looked for
anything but condemnation. We are leading no life
of self-indulgence, except, indeed, that, being happy in
each other, we find everything easy. We are working
hard to provide for others better than we provide for
ourselves, and to fulfil every responsibility that lies
upon us. Levity and pride would not be a sufficient
basis for that. Pardon me if, in vindicating myself
from some unjust conclusions, I seem too cold and
self-asserting. I should not care to vindicate myself
if I did not love you and desire to relieve you of the
pain which you say these conclusions have given you.
Whatever I may have misinterpreted before, I do not
misinterpret your letter this morning, but read in it
nothing else than love and kindness towards me, to
which my heart fully answers yes. I should like never
to write about myself again; it is not healthy to dwell
on one's own feelings and conduct, but only to try and
live more faithfully and lovingly every fresh day. I
think not one of the endless words and deeds of kindness
and forbearance you have ever shown me has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
vanished from my memory. I recall them often, and
feel, as about everything else in the past, how deficient
I have been in almost every relation of my life. But
that deficiency is irrevocable, and I can find no
strength or comfort except in "pressing forward towards
the things that are before," and trying to make
the present better than the past. But if we should
never be very near each other again, dear Cara, do
bear this faith in your mind, that I was not insensible
or ungrateful to all your goodness, and that I am one
among the many for whom you have not lived in vain.
I am very busy just now, and have been obliged to
write hastily. Bear this in mind, and believe that no
meaning is mine which contradicts my assurance that
I am your affectionate and earnest friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Journal,
20th July,
1854.</div>

<p>I said a last farewell to Cambridge Street on 20th
July, 1854, and found myself on board the <i>Ravensbourne</i>,
bound for Antwerp. The day was glorious,
and our passage perfect. The sunset was lovely, but
still lovelier the dawn as we were passing up the
Scheldt between two and three in the morning. The
crescent moon, the stars, the first faint blush of the
dawn reflected in the glassy river, the dark mass of
clouds on the horizon, which sent forth flashes of lightning,
and the graceful forms of the boats and sailing-vessels,
painted in jet-black on the reddish gold of the
sky and water, made up an unforgettable picture.
Then the sun rose and lighted up the sleepy shores of
Belgium, with their fringe of long grass, their rows of
poplars, their church spires and farm buildings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">21st July.</div>

<p>The great treat at Antwerp was the sight of the
Descent from the Cross, which, with its pendant, the
Elevation of the Cross, has been undergoing restoration.
In the latter the face of Jesus is sublime in its
expression of agony and trust in the Divine. It is
certainly the finest conception of the suffering Christ I
have ever seen. The rest of the picture gave me no
pleasure. But in the Descent from the Cross, color,
form, and expression alike impressed me with the sense
of grandeur and beauty. A little miserable copy of
the picture placed near it served as an admirable foil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">22d July.</div>

<p>We went to the museum and saw Rubens's Crucifixion,
even more beautiful to me than the Descent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
from the Cross. These two pictures profoundly impressed
me with the miserable lack of breadth and
grandeur in the conceptions of our living artists. The
reverence for the old masters is not all humbug and
superstition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30th July.</div>

<p>We breakfasted in the public room at the hotel at
Cologne, and were joined there by Dr. Brabant and
Strauss. After a short interview with them we went
on board the steamboat which was to take us to Coblentz.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weimar,
Description,
Aug.-Oct.
1854.</div>

<p>It was very pretty to look out of the window, when
dressing, on a garden that reminded one of an English
village: the town is more like a huge village, or market-town,
than the precincts of a court.</p>

<p>G. called on Schöll, and in the afternoon he (Schöll)
came and took us to the <i>Schloss</i>, where we saw the
Dichter Zimmer&mdash;a suite of rooms dedicated to Goethe,
Schiller, and Wieland. In each room there is the bust
of the poet who is its presiding genius; and the walls
of the Goethe and Schiller rooms are decorated with
frescoes representing scenes from their works. The
Wieland room is decorated with arabesques only. The
idea of these rooms is a very pretty one, but the frescoes
are badly executed. I am delighted with Schöll.
He is a bright-looking, well-made man, with his head
finely set on his shoulders, very little like a German.
We discovered, after we had known him some time,
that he is an Austrian, and so has more southern blood
in his veins than the heavy Thuringians. His manners
are hearty and cordial, and his conversation really
instructive: his ideas are so thoroughly shaped and
so admirably expressed. Sauppe is also a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gelehrter</i>,
director of the gymnasium, and editor of a series of
classics which are being brought out; and he is evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
thought a great deal of in Weimar. We went
with the Schölls and Sauppes to Tiefurt, and saw the
queer little <i>Schloss</i> which used to be Amalia's residence.
Tiefurt was a favorite resort of ours, for the
walk to it is a very pleasant one, and the Tiefurt park
is a little paradise. The Ilm is seen here to the best
advantage: it is clearer than at Weimar, and winds
about gracefully among fine trees. One of the banks
is a high, steep declivity, which shows the trees in all
their perfection. In autumn, when the yellow and
scarlet were at their brightest, these banks were fairy-like
in their beauty. It was here that Goethe and
his court friends got up the performance of "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die
Fischerin</span>" by torchlight.</p>

<p>About ten days after our arrival at Weimar we made
an excursion to Ettersburg, one of the duke's summer
residences, interesting to us beforehand as the scene
of private theatricals and <i>sprees</i> in the Goethe days.
We carried provisions with us, and Keats's poems. The
morning was one of the brightest and hottest that August
ever bestowed, and it required some resolution to
trudge along the shadeless <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaussée</i>, which formed the
first two or three miles of our way. One compensating
pleasure was the sight of the beautiful mountain
ashes in full berry, which, alternately with cherry-trees,
border the road for a considerable distance. I felt a
child's love for the bunches of coral standing out
against the blue sky. The <i>Schloss</i> is a house of very
moderate size, and no pretension of any kind. Two
flights of steps lead up to the door, and the balustrades
are ornamented with beautiful creepers. A tiny sort
of piazza under the steps is ornamented with creepers
too, and has pretty earthenware vases filled with plants
hanging from the ceiling. We felt how much beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
might be procured at small expense in looking at these
things. A beautiful walk through a beech wood took
us to the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mooshütte</i>, before which stands the beech
whereon Goethe and his friends cut their names, and
from which Goethe denounced Waldemar. We could
recognize some of the initials. With Ettersburg I shall
always associate Arthur Helps, for he was with us on
the second and last time we saw it. He came to Weimar
quite unexpectedly on the 29th August, and the
next evening we all three drove to Ettersburg. He
said the country just round Weimar reminded him of
Spain. This led him to talk of his Spanish travels,
and he told us some delightful stories in a delightful
way. At one inn he was considerably embarrassed
in eating his dinner by the presence of a handsome
woman, who sat directly opposite to him, resting on
her elbows, and fixing her dark eyes on him with a
fearful intensity of interest. This woman was the
cook, anxious to know that her dishes were acceptable
to the stranger. Under this terrible surveillance he
did not dare to omit a single dish, though sorely longing
to do so.</p>

<p>Our greatest expedition from Weimar was to Ilmenau.
We set out with a determination to find the
Gabel-Bach and Kickel-hahn (Goethe's residence) without
the encumbrance of a guide. We found the man
who inhabits the simple wooden house which used to
be Carl August's hunting-box. He sent a man on
with us to show us the way to the Kickel-hahn, which
we at last reached&mdash;I with weary legs. There is a
magnificent view of hills from this spot; but Goethe's
tiny wooden house is now closely shut in by fir-trees,
and nothing can be seen from the windows. His room,
which forms the upper floor of the house, is about ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
or twelve feet square. It is now quite empty, but there
is an interesting memorial of his presence in these
wonderful lines, written by his own hand, near the window-frame:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" lang="de" xml:lang="de">
<span class="i0">"Ueber allen Gipfeln<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ist Ruh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In allen Wipfeln<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spürest du<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kaum einen Hauch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Die Vögelein schweigen im Walde.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warte nur, balde<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruhest du auch."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We wrote our names near one of the windows.</p>

<p>About the middle of September the theatre opened,
and we went to hear "Ernani." Liszt looked splendid
as he conducted the opera. The grand outline of his
face and floating hair were seen to advantage as they
were thrown into dark relief by the stage lamps. We
were so fortunate as to have all three of Wagner's
most celebrated operas while we were at Weimar. G.,
however, had not patience to sit out more than two
acts of "Lohengrin;" and, indeed, I too was weary.
The declamation appeared to me monotonous, and situations,
in themselves trivial or disagreeable, were
dwelt on fatiguingly. Without feeling competent to
pass a judgment on this opera as music, one may venture
to say that it fails in one grand requisite of art,
based on an unchangeable element in human nature&mdash;the
need for contrast. With the "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fliegender Holländer</span>"
I was delighted; the poem and the music
were alike charming. The "Tannhäuser," too, created
in me a great desire to hear it again. Many of the
situations, and much of the music, struck me as remarkably
fine. And I appreciated these operas all the
better retrospectively when we saw "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Freischütz</span>,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
which I had never before heard and seen on the stage.
The effect of the delicious music, with which one is so
familiar, was completely spoiled by the absence of recitative,
and the terrible <i>lapsus</i> from melody to ordinary
speech. The bacchanalian song seemed simply
ridiculous, sung at a little pot-house table at a party
of <em>two</em>, one of whom was sunk in melancholy; and the
absurdity reached a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i> when Caspar climbed
the tree, apparently with the sole purpose of being shot.
<i>À propos</i> of the theatre, we were immensely amused to
learn that a fair, small-featured man, who somehow always
looked to me as if he had just come out of the
shell, had come to Weimar to fit himself for a dramatic
writer by going behind the scenes! He had as yet
written nothing, but was going to work in what he considered
a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gründlich</i> way.</p>

<p>When we passed along the Schiller Strasse, I used
to be very much thrilled by the inscription, "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hier
wohnte Schiller</span>," over the door of his small house.
Very interesting it is to see his study, which is happily
left in its original state. In his bedroom we saw his
skull for the first time, and were amazed at the smallness
of the intellectual region. There is an intensely
interesting sketch of Schiller lying dead, which I saw
for the first time in the study; but all pleasure in thinking
of Schiller's portraits and bust is now destroyed to
me by the conviction of their untruthfulness. Rauch
told us that he had a <i>miserabled
Stirne</i>.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Waagen says
that Tieck the sculptor told him there was something
in Schiller's whole person which reminded him of a
<em>camel</em>.</p>

<p>Goethe's house is much more important-looking, but,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to English eyes, far from being the palatial residence
which some German writers think it. The entrance-hall
is certainly rather imposing, with its statues in
niches, and broad staircase. The latter was made after
his own design, and was an "after-shine" of Italian
tastes. The pictures are wretched, the casts not much
better&mdash;indeed, I remember nothing which seemed intrinsically
worth looking at. The MS. of his "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Römische
Elegien</span>," written by himself in the Italian
character, is to be seen here; and one likes to look at
it better than at most of the other things. G. had obtained
permission from Frau v. Goethe to see the studio
and Schlafzimmer, which are not open to the public,
and here our feelings were deeply moved. We entered
first a small room containing drawers and shelves
devoted to his mineralogical collections. From these
we passed into the study. It is rather a dark room,
for there are only two small windows&mdash;German windows.
A plain deal table stands in the middle, and
near the chair, against this table, is a high basket,
where, I was afterwards told, Goethe used to put his
pocket-handkerchief. A long sort of writing-table and
bookcase united stands against one wall. Here hangs
the pin-cushion, just as he left it, with visiting-cards
suspended on threads, and other trifles which greatness
and death have made sacred. Against the opposite
wall, where you enter the bedroom, there is a high writing-desk,
on which stands a little statue of Napoleon
in creamy glass. The bedroom is very small. By
the side of the bed stands a stuffed arm-chair, where
he used to sit and read while he drank his coffee in
the morning. It was not until very late in his life that
he adopted the luxury of an arm-chair. From the
other side of the study one enters the library, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
fitted up in a very makeshift fashion, with rough deal
shelves, and bits of paper, with Philosophy, History, etc.,
written on them, to mark the classification of the books.
Among such memorials one breathes deeply, and the
tears rush to one's eyes. There is one likeness of
Goethe that is really startling and thrilling from the
idea it gives one of perfect resemblance. It is painted
on a cup, and is a tiny miniature, but the execution is
so perfect that, on applying a magnifying glass, every
minute stroke has as natural an appearance as the
texture of a flower or the parts of an insect under the
microscope.</p>

<p>Equally interesting is the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gartenhaus</i>, which we used
to see almost every day in our walks. Within, it is a
not uncomfortable, homely sort of cottage; no furniture
is left in it, and the family want to sell it. It stands
on a pleasant slope fronting the west, and there is a
charming bit of garden and orchard attached to it.
Close to the garden hedge runs the road which leads
to Ober Weimar, and on the other side of this road a
meadow stretches to the trees which border the Ilm.
A bridge nearly opposite the Gartenhaus takes one to
the Borkenhaus, Carl August's little retreat, from which
he used to telegraph to Goethe. The road to Ober
Weimar was one of our favorite walks, especially towards
the end of our stay at Weimar, when we were
glad of all the sunshine we could get. Sometimes we
used to turn out of it, up a grove of weeping birches,
into the ploughed fields at the top of the slope on
which the Gartenhaus and other little villas stand.
Here we enjoyed many a lovely sunset; one, in particular,
was marvellously splendid. The whole hemisphere
was golden, towards the east tinted with rose-color.
From this little height we looked on the plantations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of the park, in their autumnal coloring, the town,
with its steep-roofed church and its castle tower, colored
a gay green, the line of chestnuts along the Belvedere
Chaussée, and Belvedere itself peeping from
its nest of trees.</p>

<p>Another very favorite walk of mine was the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Webicht</i>,
a beautiful wood through which ran excellent carriage-roads
and grassy footpaths. How richly have I enjoyed
skirting this wood and seeing, on the other side,
the sky arching grandly down over the open fields, the
evening red flushing the west over the town, and the
bright stars come out as if to relieve the sun in his
watch over mortals. And then the winding road
through the Webicht on the side towards Tiefurt, with
its tall, overarching trees now bending their mossy
trunks forward, now standing with stately erectness
like lofty pillars; and the charming grassy paths
through the heart of the wood, among its silvery-barked
birches! The Webicht lies towards Tiefurt,
and one side of it is bordered by the road thither. I
remember, as we were returning from Tiefurt one evening,
a beautiful effect of the setting sunlight pouring
itself under the trees, and making the road before us
almost crimson.</p>

<p>One of our pleasantest acquaintances at Weimar
was the French ambassador, the Marquis de Ferrière, a
very favorable specimen of a Frenchman, but intensely
French. His genial soul and perfect good-humor gave
one the same sort of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien-être</i> as a well-stuffed arm-chair
and a warm hearthrug. In the course of conversation,
speaking of Yvan's accounts of his travels (the
marquis was first secretary to the Chinese embassy
which Yvan accompanied), he said, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'était faux d'un
bout à l'autre; mais c'était spirituel, paradoxal, amusant&mdash;enfin</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tout ce qu'il fallait pour un journal</i>.</span>" Another
day he observed that the famous words of Napoleon
to his Egyptian army, "Forty centuries look
down on you from the summits of these pyramids,"
were characteristic of the French national feeling, as
those of Nelson, "England expects the man to make
his duty" were of the English. This is a fair specimen
of the correctness with which one generally hears
English quoted; and we often reminded ourselves that
it was a mirror in which we might see our own German.</p>

<p>Liszt's conversation is charming. I never met with
a person whose manner of telling a story was so piquant.
The last evening but one that he called on us,
wishing to express his pleasure in G.'s article about
him, he very ingeniously conveyed that expression in a
story about Spontini and Berlioz. Spontini visited
Paris while Liszt was living there, and haunted the
opera&mdash;a stiff, self-important personage, with high
shirt-collars, the least attractive individual imaginable;
Liszt turned up his own collars, and swelled out his
person, so as to give us a vivid idea of the man. Every
one would have been glad to get out of Spontini's
way&mdash;indeed, elsewhere "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on feignait de le croire mort</span>,"
but at Paris, as he was a member of the Institute, it
was necessary to recognize his existence. Liszt met
him at Erard's more than once. On one of these occasions
Liszt observed to him that Berlioz was a great
admirer of his (Spontini's), whereupon Spontini burst
into a terrible invective against Berlioz as a man who,
with the like of him, was ruining art, etc. Shortly after
the "Vestale" was performed, and forthwith appeared
an enthusiastic article by Berlioz on Spontini's music.
The next time Liszt met him of the high collars he
said, "You see I was not wrong in what I said about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Berlioz's admiration of you." Spontini swelled in his
collars, and replied, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur, Berlioz a du talent
comme critique!</span>"</p>

<p>Liszt's replies were always felicitous and characteristic.
Talking of Mme. d'Agoult, he told us that when
her novel "Nelida" appeared, in which Liszt himself
is pilloried as a delinquent, he asked her, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais pourquoi
avez-vous tellement maltraité ce pauvre Lehmann?</span>"
The first time we were asked to breakfast at
his house, the Altenburg, we were shown into the garden,
where, in a saloon formed by overarching trees,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i> was set out. We found Hoffmann von
Fallersleben, the lyric poet, Dr. Schade&mdash;a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gelehrter</i>,
and Cornelius. Presently came a Herr&mdash;or Doctor&mdash;Raff,
a musician, who has recently published a volume
called "Wagnerfrage." Soon after we were joined by
Liszt and the Princess Marie, an elegant, gentle-looking
girl of seventeen, and last by the Princess Wittgenstein,
with her nephew, Prince Eugène, and a young
French artist, a pupil of Scheffer. The princess was
tastefully dressed in a morning-robe of some semi-transparent
white material, lined with orange-color,
which formed the bordering and ornamented the
sleeves, a black lace jacket, and a piquant cap set on
the summit of her comb, and trimmed with violet color.
When the cigars came, Hoffman was requested to read
some of his poetry, and he gave us a bacchanalian
poem with great spirit. I sat next to Liszt, and my
great delight was to watch him and observe the sweetness
of his expression. Genius, benevolence, and tenderness
beam from his whole countenance, and his
manners are in perfect harmony with it. Then came
the thing I had longed for&mdash;his playing. I sat near
him, so that I could see both his hands and face. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the first time in my life I beheld real inspiration&mdash;for
the first time I heard the true tones of the piano. He
played one of his own compositions&mdash;one of a series
of religious fantasies. There was nothing strange or
excessive about his manner. His manipulation of the
instrument was quiet and easy, and his face was simply
grand&mdash;the lips compressed, and the head thrown
a little backward. When the music expressed quiet
rapture or devotion a smile flitted over his features;
when it was triumphant the nostrils dilated. There
was nothing petty or egoistic to mar the picture. Why
did not Scheffer paint him thus, instead of representing
him as one of the three Magi? But it just occurs
to me that Scheffer's idea was a sublime one. There
are the two aged men who have spent their lives in
trying to unravel the destinies of the world, and who
are looking for the Deliverer&mdash;for the light from on
high. Their young fellow-seeker, having the fresh inspiration
of early life, is the first to discern the herald
star, and his ecstasy reveals it to his companions. In
this young Magus, Scheffer has given a portrait of
Liszt; but even here, where he might be expected
to idealize unrestrainedly, he falls short of the original.
It is curious that Liszt's face is the type that one sees
in all Scheffer's pictures; at least, in all I have seen.</p>

<p>In a little room which terminates the suite at the
Altenburg there is a portrait of Liszt, also by Scheffer&mdash;the
same of which the engraving is familiar to every
one. This little room is filled with memorials of Liszt's
triumphs and the worship his divine talent has won. It
was arranged for him by the princess, in conjunction
with the Arnims, in honor of his birthday. There is a
medallion of him by Schwanthaler, a bust by an Italian
artist, also a medallion by Rietschl&mdash;very fine&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
cabinets full of jewels and precious things&mdash;the Weimar
gifts of the great. In the music <i>salon</i> stand Beethoven's
and Mozart's pianos. Beethoven's was a present
from Broadwood, and has a Latin inscription intimating
that it was presented as a tribute to his illustrious
genius. One evening Liszt came to dine with us at
the Erb Prinz, and introduced M. Rubinstein, a young
Russian, who is about to have an opera of his performed
in Weimar. Our expenses at Weimar, including wine
and washing, were £2 6<i>s.</i> per week. Dear Weimar!
We were sorry to say good-bye to it, with its pleasant
group of friends. On the 4th of November, after a
stay of just three months, we turned our backs on it
"to seek fresh streets and faces new" at Berlin.</p>

<p>There are certain persons without any physiognomy,
the catalogue of whose features, as, item, a Roman nose,
item, a pair of black eyes, etc., gives you the entire contents
of their faces. There is no difference of opinion
about the looks of such people. All the world is agreed
either that they are pretty or ugly. So it is with Berlin.
Every one tells you it is an uninteresting modern city,
with broad, monotonous streets; and when you see it,
you cannot for the life of you get up an emotion of surprise,
or make a remark about the place which you
have not heard before.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival was Sunday, 6th November;
the sun shone brightly, and we went to walk in the
Linden, elbowing our way among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">promeneurs endimanchés</i>,
who looked remarkably smart and handsome
after the Thuringians. We had not gone far when we
met a nice-looking old gentleman, with an order round
his neck, and a gold-headed cane in his hand, who exclaimed,
on seeing G., "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ist's möglich?</span>" and then bade
him heartily welcome. I saw at once it was the Varnhagen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of whom I had heard so often. His niece, arrayed
in smiles and a pink bonnet, was with him.</p>

<p>For the first six weeks, when the weather permitted,
we took long walks in the Thiergarten, where the
straight and uniform avenues of insignificant trees contrasted
very disadvantageously with the charming variety
of our beloved park at Weimar. Still, we now
and then noticed a beautiful wintry effect, especially in
the part most remote from the town, where the trees
are finer and the arrangements more varied. One
walk, which skirted the Thiergarten on the right-hand
side coming from the town, we were particularly fond
of, because it gave us on one side an open view, with
water and a boat or two, which, touched by the magic
of sunshine, was pleasant to see. At Berlin it was "a
day of small things" with regard to the beautiful, and
we made much of little.</p>

<p>Our little circle of acquaintances was very agreeable
and varied. Varnhagen was a real treasure to G., for
his library supplied all the deficiencies of the public
one, where to ask for books was generally like "sinking
buckets into empty wells." He is a man of real
culture, kindliness, and polish (Germanly speaking);
and he has besides that thorough liberalism, social, religious,
and political, which sets the mind at ease in
conversation, and delivers it from the fear of running
against some prejudice, or coming suddenly on the
sunk fence of some miserable limitation. The first
morning he called on us he talked of his terrible disappointment
in Carlyle, a subject to which he often
returned. He evidently felt an antipathy to the "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Teufelsdröckh</span>,"
which, indeed, it was not difficult to understand
from the mere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manière d'étre</i> of the two men.
They had corresponded for years before they saw each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
other; and Varnhagen was, and is, a great admirer of
Carlyle's best work, but he was thoroughly repelled
by his rough, paradoxical talk, and, more justifiably, by
the despotic doctrines which it has been his humor to
teach of late. We were amused to hear that Carlyle
said he should think no one could die at Berlin, "for
in beds <em>without curtains</em> what Christian could give up
the ghost?"</p>

<p>At Varnhagen's we met, for the first time, Professor
Stahr, who was there with Fanny Lewald, Fräulein
Solmar, Frau Muisch, Dr. Ring, Dr. Vehse, Gräfin von
Kalkreuth, and Director Wilhelm Schadow, author of
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Moderne Vasari</span>." We talked of Goethe. Varnhagen
brought out autographs and portraits, and read
us an epigram of his own on the want of liberality which
Goethe's family show about opening his house to the
public. He showed us a portrait of Kleist, who shot
himself, in company with Frau Vogel, near an inn on
the way to Potsdam. There was no love-affair between
them; they were both thoroughly unhappy&mdash;he
poor and hopeless for the future; and she suffering
from an incurable disease. In the evening they both
wrote, on a single sheet of paper, letters to their friends,
communicating their intention (this sheet Varnhagen
possesses). Early in the morning they rose, took a
cup of coffee, went to the brink of a piece of water in
the neighborhood of the inn, and there shot themselves.</p>

<p>Du Bois Reymond spoke very decidedly of the German
civilization as inferior to the English.</p>

<p>Varnhagen, when well, is a regular visitor at Fräulein
Solmar's, who for many years has kept an open
<i>salon</i> for her friends every evening but one in the week.
Here the three-cornered chair next the sofa was reserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
for him, except when General Pfuhl was there. This
General Pfuhl is a fine specimen of an old soldier, who
is at the same time a man of instruction and of strong
social sympathies. He has been in the service of
Prussia, has been within a hair's-breadth of being
frozen to death, "and so following." He spoke French
admirably, and always had something interesting and
characteristic to tell or say. His appreciatory groans,
always in the right place, when G. was reading "Shylock"
did us both good, under the chills of a German
audience. Fräulein Solmar is a remarkably accomplished
woman&mdash;probably between fifty and sixty, but
of that agreeable <i>Wesen</i> which is so free from anything
startling in person or manner, and so at home in
everything one can talk of, that you think of her simply
as a delightful presence, and not as a woman of
any particular age. She converses perfectly in French,
well in English, and well also, as we were told, in Italian.
There is not the slightest warmth of manner or
expression in her, but always the same even cheerfulness
and intelligence&mdash;in fact, she is the true type of
the mistress of the <i>salon</i>. During the first half of our
stay in Berlin we went about once a week to her house;
but bad health and bad weather kept us away during
the last six weeks, except for one or two evenings.
Baron Sternberg, the novelist, used frequently to glide
in when we were there, and cast strange, cold glances
around, talking quietly to Fräulein Assing or some
other lady who sat in a distant parallel of latitude.</p>

<p>One evening a Frenchman there amused us by saying
that he found in Meyerbeer's "Huguenots" the
whole spirit of the epoch of Charles IX. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lisez les
Chroniques"&mdash;"de Froissart?</span>" suggested Mlle. Solmar.
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, quelque chose comme ça; ou bien les Chroniques</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Brantôme ou de <i>Mérimée</i>, et vous trouverez que
Meyerbeer a parfaitement exprimé tout cela; du moins
c'est ce que je trouve, moi.</span>" I said, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais peut-être,
Monsieur, c'est votre génie à vous qui a fait entrer les
idées dans la musique.</span>" He answered with complacent
deprecation. G. looked immovably serious, but
was inwardly tickled by the audacity of my compliment,
and the evident acceptance of it.</p>

<p>A still more interesting acquaintance was Professor
Gruppe, who has written great books on the Greek
drama and on Philosophy; has been a political writer;
is a lyric and epic poet; has invented a beautiful kind
of marbled paper for binding books; is an enthusiastic
huntsman, and, withal, the most simple, kind-hearted
creature in the world. His little wife, who is about
twenty years younger than himself, seems to adore him,
and it is charming to see the group they and their two
little children make in their dwelling, up endless flights
of stairs in the Leipziger Platz. Very pleasant evenings
we had there, chatting or playing whist, or listening
to readings of Gruppe's poems. We used to find
him in a gray cloth <i>Schlafrock</i>, which I fancy was once
a great-coat, and a brown velvet cap surmounting his
thin gray hairs. I never saw a combination at all like
that which makes up Gruppe's character. Talent,
fertility, and versatility that seem to indicate a fervid
temperament, and yet no scintillation of all this in his
talk and manner; on the contrary, he seems slow at
apprehending other people's ideas, and is of an almost
childish <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naiveté</i> in the value he attaches to poor jokes,
and other trivialities. <i>À propos</i> of jokes, we noticed
that during the whole seven months of our stay in Germany
we never heard one witticism, or even one felicitous
idea or expression, from a German!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Gruppe has a delightful library, with rare books, and
books too good to be rare; and we often applied to
him for some of them. He lent me "Lessing," and
that is an additional circumstance to remember with
pleasure in connection with the Laocoon. He one
evening gave us an interesting account of his work on
the cosmic system of the Greeks, and read us a translation,
by himself, of one of the Homeric hymns&mdash;Aphrodite&mdash;which
is very beautiful, a sort of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gegenstück</i>
to "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Gott und die Bajadere</span>:" and generally
we were glad when he took up the book. He read us
a specimen of his epic poem, "Firdusi," which pleased
us. The fable on which this poem is founded is fine.
The sultan had engaged Firdusi to write a great poem
on his exploits, and had promised to pay for this one
hundred thousand pieces (gold being understood).
Firdusi had delighted in the thought of this sum, which
he intended to devote to the benefit of his native city.
When the poem was delivered, and the sack of money
given to Firdusi, he found that the pieces were silver!
He burst into a song of scorn against the sultan, and
paid the miserable sum to his bath-man. Gruppe
thinks Shakespeare more extensively sold in Germany
than any other book, except the Bible and Schiller!
One night we attempted "Brag" or "Pocher," but
Gruppe presently became alarmed at G.'s play, and
said "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das würde an zwölf Groschen reichen</span>." He
drew some Jews' faces with a pen admirably.</p>

<p>We were invited to meet Waagen, whom we found a
very intelligent and amusing man. He told us a story
about Goethe, who said of some one, "I thank thee,
Almighty God, that thou hast produced no second edition
of this man!" and an amusing judgment passed
on Goethe himself, that he was "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kein dummer Mann!</span>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Also a story of a lady who went to see him, as an intellectual
adorer, and began to spout to him, as his
masterpiece, "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fest gemauert in der
Erden</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> etc.</p>

<p>Another pleasant friend was Edward Magnus, the
portrait-painter, an acute, intelligent, kind-hearted man,
with real talent in his art. He was the only German
we met with who seemed conscious of his countrymen's
deficiencies. He showed in every possible way
a hearty desire to do us service&mdash;sent us books, came
to chat with us, showed us his portraits, and, when we
were going away, brought us lithographs of some paintings
of his, that we might carry away a remembrance
of him. He has travelled very extensively, and had
much intercourse with distinguished people, and these
means of culture have had some of their best effects
on his fine temperament and direct, truthful mind. He
told us a rich story about Carlyle. At a dinner-party,
given by Magnus in his honor, Wiese and Cornelius
were deploring Goethe's want of evangelical sentiment.
Carlyle was visibly uneasy, fumbling with his dinner-napkin.
At last he broke out thus: "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meine Herren kennen
sie die Anekdote von dem Manne der die Sonne
lästerte weil sie ihm sein Cigarre nicht anstecken
liess?</span>"<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>In the little room where we used to be ushered to
wait for him there was a portrait of Thorwaldsen and
one of Mendelssohn, both of whom he knew well. I
was surprised to find in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</i> the original of the
portrait of Jenny Lind, with which I was so familiar.
He was going to send it, together with Sontag's portrait,
to the exhibition at Paris. His brother, the
chemist, was also a bright, good-natured-looking man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
We were invited to a large evening party at his house,
and found very elegant rooms, with a remarkable assemblage
of celebrated men&mdash;Johannes Müller, Du
Bois Reymond, Rose, Ehrenberg, etc. Some of the
women were very pretty and well dressed. The supper,
brought round on trays, was well appointed; and
altogether the party was well managed.</p>

<p>We spent one evening with Professor Stahr and his
wife&mdash;Fanny Lewald&mdash;after their marriage. Stahr has
a copy of the charming miniature of Schiller, taken
when he was about thirty&mdash;a miniature in the possession
of a certain Madame von Kalb. There are the
long <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gänsehals</i>,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
the aquiline nose, the blue eyes and
auburn hair. It is a most real and striking portrait.
I saw also a portrait and bust of Madame d'Agoult
here, both rather handsome. The first evening Stahr
told us some of the grievances which the Prussians
have to bear from their government, and among the
rest the vexatious necessity for a "concession" or license,
before any, the simplest vocation, can be entered
on. He observed, with justice, that the English are
apt to suppose the German Revolution of '48 was mere
restlessness and aping of other nations, when in fact
there were real oppressions which the Germans had to
bear, and which they had borne with a patience that
the English would not imitate for a month. By far the
most distinguished-looking man we saw at Berlin, and,
indeed, next to Liszt, in Germany, was Rauch the sculptor.
Schöll had given G. a letter for him, and soon
after it had been left at his house he called on us in
the evening, and at once won our hearts by his beautiful
person and the benignant and intelligent charm of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
his conversation. He is indeed the finest old man I
ever saw&mdash;more than seventy-six, I believe, but perfectly
upright, even stately, in his carriage. His features are
harmonious, his complexion has a delicate freshness,
his silky white hair waves gracefully round his high
forehead, and his brown eyes beam with benevolence
and intelligence. He is above the common height, and
his stature and beauty together ennoble the gray working
surtout and cap which he wears in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</i> into a
picturesque and distinguished costume. The evening
he was with us he talked delightfully of Goethe, dwelling
especially on his lovable nature. He described
very graphically Goethe's way of introducing subjects,
showing plates, etc., bringing in the cast of Schiller's
skull, and talking of it and other little particulars of
interest. We went one morning to his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</i>, and
found him superintending his pupil's work at a large
group representing Moses with his hands held up by
Aaron and Hur. It was extremely interesting to me
to see Rauch's original little clay model of this group,
for I had never seen statuary in that first stage before.
The intense expression of entreaty in the face of the
Moses was remarkable. But the spirit of this group is
so alien to my sympathies that I could feel little pleasure
in the idea of its production. On the other hand,
my heart leaped at the sight of old Kant's quaint figure,
of which Rauch is commissioned to produce a colossal
statue for Königsberg. In another <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</i>, where the
work is in a different stage, we saw a splendid marble
monument, nearly completed, of the late king of Hanover.
Pitiable that genius and spotless white marble
should be thrown away on such human trash! Our
second visit to Rauch's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</i> was paid shortly before
we left Berlin. The group of Moses, Aaron, and Hur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
was clothed up, and the dark-eyed, olive-complexioned
pupil was at work on a pretty little figure of Hope&mdash;a
child stepping forward with upturned face, a bunch of
flowers in her hand. In the other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</i> we saw a bust
of Schleiermacher, which, with the equestrian statue of
Fritz, and its pedestal, Rauch was going to send to the
Paris Exhibition. Schleiermacher's face is very delicately
cut, and indicates a highly susceptible temperament.
The colossal head of Fritz, seen on a level with
one's eye, was perfectly startling from its living expression.
One can't help fancying that the head is thinking
and that the eyes are seeing.</p>

<p>Dessoir the actor was another pleasant variety in
our circle of acquaintance. He created in us a real
respect and regard for him, not only by his sincere devotion
to his art, but by the superiority of feeling which
shone through all the little details of his conduct and
conversation. Of lowly birth, and entirely self-taught,
he is by nature a gentleman. Without a single physical
gift as an actor, he succeeds, by force of enthusiasm
and conscientious study, in arriving at a representation
which commands one's attention and feelings. I was
very much pleased by the simplicity with which he one
day said, "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Shakespeare ist mein Gott; ich habe keinen
anderen Gott</span>:" and indeed one saw that his art was a
religion to him. He said he found himself inevitably
led into singsong declamation by Schiller, but with
Shakespeare it was impossible to be declamatory. It
was very agreeable to have him as a companion now
and then in our walks, and to have him read or discuss
Shakespeare for an hour or two in the evening. He
told us an amusing story about his early days. When
he was a youth of sixteen or seventeen, acting at Spandau,
he walked to Berlin (about nine miles) and back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
in the evening, accompanied by a watchmaker named
Naundorff, an enthusiast for the theatre. On their way
Dessoir declaimed at the top of his voice, and was encouraged
by the applause of his companion to more
and more exertion of lungs and limbs, so that people
stared at them, and followed them, as if they thought
them two madmen. This watchmaker was Louis
XVII.! Dessoir also imitated admirably Aldridge's
mode of advancing to kill Duncan&mdash;like a wild Indian
lurking for a not much wilder beast. He paid us the
very pretty attention of getting up a dinner for us at
Dietz's, and inviting Rötscher and Förster to meet us;
and he supplied us with tickets for the theatre, which,
however, was a pleasure we used sparingly. The first
time we went was to see "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nathan der Weise</span>"&mdash;a real
enjoyment, for the elegant theatre was new to us, and
the scenery was excellent; better than I saw there on
any subsequent occasion. Döring performed Nathan,
and we thus saw him for the first time to great advantage;
for, though he drags down this part, as he does
all others, the character of Nathan sets limits which he
cannot overstep; and though we lose most of its elevation
in Döring's acting, we get, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en revanche</i>, an admirable
ease and naturalness. His fine, clear voice
and perfect enunciation told excellently in the famous
monologue, and in the whole scene with Saladin. Our
hearts swelled and the tears came into our eyes as we
listened to the noble words of dear Lessing, whose
great spirit lives immortally in this crowning work of his.</p>

<p>Our great anxiety was to see and hear Johanna
Wagner, so we took tickets for the "Orpheus," which
Mlle. Solmar told us she thought her best part. We
were thoroughly delighted both with her and her music.
The caricatures of the Furies, the ballet-girls, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
butcher-like Greek shades in Elysium, the ugly, screaming
Eurydice, and the droll appearance of Timzek as
Amor, in which she looked like a shop-girl who has
donned a masquerade dress impromptu, without changing
her headdress&mdash;all these absurdities were rather an
amusement than a drawback to our pleasure; for the
Orpheus was perfect in himself, and looked like a noble
horse among mules and donkeys.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
9th Jan.
1855.</div>

<p>Our days are so accurately parcelled out that my
time for letter-writing is rather restricted, and for every
letter I write I have to leave out something which we
have learned to think necessary. We have been to
hear "Fidelio" this evening&mdash;not well executed, except
so far as the orchestra was concerned; but the
divine music positively triumphs over the defects of
execution. One is entirely wrapped in the <em>idea</em> of the
composer. Last week we had "Orpheus and Eurydice,"
and I heard, for the first time, at once an opera of
Gluck's and Johanna Wagner. It is one of the glories
of Berlin to give Gluck's operas, and it is also something
of a glory to have "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Wagner</span>." She is really a fine actress
and a fine singer; her voice is not ravishing, but
she is mistress of it. I thought of you that evening, and
wished you could hear and see what I know would interest
you greatly&mdash;I refer rather to Gluck's opera than
to Johanna Wagner. The scene in which Orpheus
(Johanna Wagner) enters Tartarus, is met by the awful
Shades, and charms them into ecstatic admiration till
they make way for him to pass on, is very fine. The
voices&mdash;except in the choruses&mdash;are all women's
voices; and there are only three characters&mdash;Orpheus,
Amor, and Eurydice. One wonders that Pluto does
not come as a basso; and one would prefer Mercury
as a tenor to Amor in the shape of an ugly German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
soprano; but Gluck wished it otherwise, and the music
is delightful. I am reading a charming book by
Professor Stahr&mdash;who is one of our acquaintances here&mdash;"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Torso:
Kunst, Künstler, und Kunst Werke der
Alten.</span>" It feeds the fresh interest I am now feeling in
art. Professor Stahr is a very erudite man, and, what is
very much rarer among Germans, a good writer, who
knows how to select his materials, and has, above all,
a charming talent for description. We saw at his house
the other night the first portrait of Schiller which
<em>convinces</em> me of a likeness to him. It is the copy of a
miniature which has never been engraved. The face is
less beautiful than that of the ordinary busts and portraits,
but is very remarkable&mdash;the eyes blue, the complexion
very fair (the picture was taken in his youth),
and the hair sunny. He has the long "goose-neck"
which he describes as belonging to Carl Moor in the
"Robbers," and the forehead is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fuyant</i> in correspondence
with the skull. The piteous contrast there is between
the anxiety poor Schiller is constantly expressing
about a livelihood&mdash;about the thalers he has to pay for
this and the thalers he has to receive for that&mdash;and
Goethe's perfect ease in that respect! For the "History
of the Netherlands" he got little more than fifteen
shillings per sheet. I am very much interested in
Professor Gruppe as a type of the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gelehrter</i>.
He has written books on everything&mdash;on the Greek
drama, a great book on the cosmic system of the
Greeks, an epic, numberless lyric poems, etc.; he has
a philosophical work and a history of literature in the
press; is professor of philosophy at the university; is
enthusiastic about boar-hunting, and has written a
volume of hunting poems&mdash;and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ich weiss nicht was</i>.
Withal he is as simple as a child. When we go to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
them in the evening we find him wrapped in a moth-eaten
gray coat and a cap on his head. Then he reads us a
translation of one of the Homeric hymns, and goes
into the most naïve <em>impersonal</em> ecstasy at the beauty of
his own poetry (which is really good). The other night
he read us part of an epic which is still in MS., and is
to be read before the king&mdash;such is the fashion here.
And his little wife, who is about twenty years younger
than himself, listens with loving admiration. Altogether,
they and their two little children are a charming
picture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Berlin,
Recollections,
1854-55.</div>

<p>We went to only one concert, for which Vivier was
kind enough to send us tickets. It was given by him
and Roger, assisted by Arabella Goddard and Johanna
Wagner. Roger's singing of the "Erl King" was a
treat not to be forgotten. He gave the full effect to
Schubert's beautiful and dramatic music; and his way
of falling from melody into awe-struck speech in the
final words "<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">War todt</i>" abides with one. I never felt
so thoroughly the beauty of that divine ballad before.
The king was present in all his toothlessness and blinkingness;
and the new princess from Anhalt Dessau,
young and delicate-looking, was there too. Arabella
Goddard played the "Harmonious Blacksmith" charmingly,
and then Wagner sang badly two ineffective German
songs, and Halévy's duet from the "Reine de
Chypre" with Roger.</p>

<p>Vivier is amusing. He says Germans take off their
hats on all possible pretexts&mdash;not for the sake of
politeness, but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour être embarrassants</i>. They have
wide streets, simply to embarrass you, by making it
impossible to descry a shop or a friend. A German
always has <em>three</em> gloves&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On ne sait pas pourquoi.</span>"
There is a dog-tax in order to maintain a narrow <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trottoir</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
in Berlin, and every one who keeps a dog feels
authorized to keep the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trottoir</i> and move aside for no
one. If he has two dogs he drives out of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trottoir</i>
the man who has only one: the very dogs begin to be
aware of it. If you kick one when he is off the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trottoir</i>
he will bear it patiently, but on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trottoir</i> he resents it
vehemently. He gave us quite a bit of Molière in a
description of a mystification at a restaurant. He says
to the waiter&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Vous voyez ce monsieur là. C'est le
pauvre M. Colignon." (Il faut qu'il soit quelq'un qui
prend très peu&mdash;une tasse de café ou comme ça, et
qui ne dépense pas trop.) "Je suis son ami. Il est
fou. Je le garde. Combien doit-il payer?" "Un
franc." "Voilà."</span> Then Vivier goes out. Presently
the so-called M. Colignon asks how much he has to
pay, and is driven to exasperation by the reiterated
assurance of the waiter&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est payé, M. Colignon.</span>"</p>

<p>The first work of art really worth looking at that one
sees at Berlin is the "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rosse-bändiger</span>" in front of
the palace. It is by a sculptor named Cotes, who
made horses his especial study; and certainly, to us,
they eclipsed the famous Colossi at Monte Cavallo,
casts of which are in the new museum.</p>

<p>The collection of pictures at the old museum has
three gems, which remain in the imagination&mdash;Titian's
Daughter, Correggio's Jupiter and Io, and his Head
of Christ on the Handkerchief. I was pleased also to
recognize among the pictures the one by Jan Steen,
which Goethe describes in the "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wahlverwandschaften</span>"
as the model of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tableau vivant</i>, presented by Luciane
and her friends. It is the daughter being reproved by
her father, while the mother is emptying her wine-glass.
It is interesting to see the statue of Napoleon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the worker of so much humiliation to Prussia, placed
opposite that of Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>They were very happy months we spent at Berlin, in
spite of the bitter cold which came on in January and
lasted almost till we left. How we used to rejoice in
the idea of our warm room and coffee as we battled
our way from dinner against the wind and snow! Then
came the delightful long evening, in which we read
Shakespeare, Goethe, Heine, and Macaulay, with German
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Pfefferkuchen</i> and <i>Semmels</i> at the end to complete
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noctes cenæque deûm</i>.</p>

<p>We used often to turn out for a little walk in the evening,
when it was not too cold, to refresh ourselves by a
little pure air as a change from the stove-heated room.
Our favorite walk was along the Linden, in the broad
road between the trees. We used to pace to old Fritz's
monument, which loomed up dark and mysterious
against the sky. Once or twice we went along the gas-lighted
walk towards Kroll's. One evening in our last
week we went on to the bridge leading to the Wilhelm
Stadt, and there by moon and gas light saw the only
bit of picturesqueness Berlin afforded us. The outline
of the Schloss towards the water is very varied, and a
light in one of the windows near the top of a tower was
a happy accident. The row of houses on the other
side of the water was shrouded in indistinctness, and
no ugly object marred the scene. The next day, under
the light of the sun, it was perfectly prosaic.</p>

<p>Our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d'hôte</i> at the Hotel de l'Europe was so slow
in its progress from one course to another, and there
was so little encouragement to talk to our neighbors,
that we used to take our books by way of beguiling the
time. Lessing's "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hamburgische Briefe</span>," which I am
not likely to take up again, will thus remain associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
in my memory with my place at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d'hôte</i>. The
company here, as almost everywhere else in Berlin, was
sprinkled with officers. Indeed, the swords of officers
threaten one's legs at every turn in the streets, and one
sighs to think how these unproductive consumers of
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wurst</i>, with all their blue and scarlet broadcloth, are
maintained out of the pockets of the community.
Many of the officers and privates are startlingly tall;
indeed, some of them would match, I should think, with
the longest of Friedrich Wilhelm's <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">lange Kerle</i>.</p>

<p>It was a bitterly cold, sleety morning&mdash;the 11th of
March&mdash;when we set out from Berlin, leaving behind
us, alas! G.'s rug, which should have kept his feet
warm on the journey. Our travelling companions to
Cologne were fat Madame Roger, her little daughter,
and her dog, and a queen's messenger&mdash;a very agreeable
man, who afterwards persuaded another of the
same vocation to join us for the sake of warmth. This
poor man's teeth were chattering with cold, though he
was wrapped in fur; and we, all furless as we were,
pitied him, and were thankful that at least we were not
feverish and ill, as he evidently was. We saw the immortal
old town of Wolfenbüttel at a distance, as we
rolled along; beyond this there was nothing of interest
in our first day's journey, and the only incident was
the condemnation of poor Madame Roger's dog to the
dog-box, apart from its mistress with her warm cloaks.
She remonstrated in vain with a brutal German official,
and it was amusing to hear him say to her in German,
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wenn sie Deutsch nicht verstehen können.</span>" <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Eh
bien&mdash;prenez la." "Ah! quel satan de pays!"</span> was
her final word, as she held out the shivering little
beast.</p>

<p>We stayed at Cologne, and next morning walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
out to look at the cathedral again. Melancholy as
ever in its impression upon me! From Cologne to
Brussels we had some rather interesting companions,
in two French artists who were on their way from
Russia. Strange beings they looked to us at first, in
their dirty linen, Russian caps, and other queer equipments;
but in this, as in many other cases, I found
that a first impression was an extremely mistaken one&mdash;for
instead of being, as I imagined, common, uncultivated
men, they were highly intelligent.</p>

<p>At Brussels, as we took our supper, we had the
pleasure of looking at Berlioz's fine head and face, he
being employed in the same way on the other side of
the table. The next morning to Calais.</p>

<blockquote><p>They were pleasant days those at Weimar and
Berlin, and they were working days. Mr. Lewes was
engaged in completing his "Life of Goethe," which
had been begun some time before, but which was
now for the most part rewritten. At Weimar, George
Eliot wrote the article on Victor Cousin's "Madame
de Sablé" for the <cite>Westminster Review</cite>. It was begun
on 5th August, and sent off on 8th September.
At Berlin she nearly finished the translation of
Spinoza's "Ethics"&mdash;begun on 5th November&mdash;and
wrote an article on Vehse's "Court of Austria,"
which was begun on 23d January, and finished
4th March, 1855. Besides this writing, I
find the following among the books that were engaging
their attention; and in collecting the names
from George Eliot's Journal, I have transcribed
any remarks she makes on them:</p></blockquote>

<p>Sainte-Beuve, Goethe's "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wahlverwandschaften</span>," Rameau's
"Neffe," "Egmont," "The Hoggarty Diamond,"
Moore's "Life of Sheridan"&mdash;a first-rate specimen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
bad biographical writing; "Götz" and the "Bürger
General," Uhland's poems, "Wilhelm Meister," Rosenkranz
on the Faust Sage, Heine's poems, Shakespeare's
plays ("Merchant of Venice," "Romeo and
Juliet," "Julius Cæsar"&mdash;very much struck with the
masculine style of this play, and its vigorous moderation,
compared with "Romeo and Juliet"&mdash;"Antony
and Cleopatra," "Henry IV.," "Othello," "As You
Like It," "Lear"&mdash;sublimely powerful&mdash;"Taming of
the Shrew," "Coriolanus," "Twelfth Night," "Measure
for Measure," "Midsummer-Night's Dream," "Winter's
Tale," "Richard III.," "Hamlet"); Lessing's
"Laocoon"&mdash;the most un-German of all the German
books that I have ever read. The style is strong,
clear, and lively; the thoughts acute and pregnant.
It is well adapted to rouse an interest both in the
classics and in the study of art; "Emilia Galotti"
seems to me a wretched mistake of Lessing's. The
Roman myth of Virginius is grand, but the situation,
transported to modern times and divested of its political
bearing, is simply shocking. Read "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Briefe
über Spinoza</span>" (Jacobi's), "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nathan der Weise</span>," Fanny
Lewald's "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wandlungen</span>," "Minna von Barnhelm,"
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Italiänische Reise</span>," the "Residence in Rome;" a
beautiful description of Rome and the Coliseum by
moonlight&mdash;a fire made in the Coliseum sending its
smoke, silvered by the moonlight, through the arches
of the mighty walls. Amusing story of Goethe's landlady's
cat worshipping Jupiter by licking his beard&mdash;a
miracle, in her esteem, explained by Goethe as a discovery
the cat had made of the oil lodging in the undulations
of the beard. "Residence in Naples"&mdash;pretty
passage about a star seen through a chink in
the ceiling as he lay in bed. It is remarkable that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
when Goethe gets to Sicily he is, for the first time in
Italy, enthusiastic in his descriptions of natural beauty.
Read Scherr's "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte Deutscher Cultur und
Sitte</span>"&mdash;much interested in his sketch of German poetry
in the Middle Ages; "Iphigenia." Looked into
the "Xenien," and amused ourselves with their pointlessness.
"Hermann and Dorothea," "Tasso," "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wanderjahre</span>"&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à
mourir d'ennui</i>; Heine's "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geständnisse</span>"&mdash;immensely
amused with the wit of it in the first fifty
pages, but afterwards it burns low, and the want of
principle and purpose make it wearisome. Lessing's
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hamburgische Briefe</span>." Read Goethe's wonderful
observations on Spinoza. Particularly struck with
the beautiful modesty of the passage in which he says
he cannot presume to say that he thoroughly understands
Spinoza. Read "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dichtung und Wahrheit</span>,"
Knight's "Studies of Shakespeare." Talked of the
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wahlverwandschaften</span>" with Stahr&mdash;he finding fault
with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i>, which I defended. Read Stahr's
"Torso"&mdash;too long-winded a style for reading aloud.
Knight's "History of Painting." Compared several
scenes of "Hamlet" in Schlegel's translation with the
original. It is generally very close, and often admirably
well done; but Shakespeare's strong, concrete
language is almost always weakened. For example,
"Though this hand were <em>thicker than</em> itself in brother's
blood" is rendered, "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Auch um und um in Bruder's
Blut getauchet.</span>" The prose speeches of Hamlet lose
all their felicity in the translation. Read Stahr on the
Eginetan Sculptures, "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Neue Melusine," "West-Östliche
Divan,"</span> Gervinus on Shakespeare&mdash;found it
unsatisfactory; Stahr's "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein Jahr in Italien</span>"&mdash;the description
of Florence excellent. Read the wonderfully
beautiful "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Römische Elegien</span>" again, and some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the Venetian epigrams, Vehse's "Court of Austria"&mdash;called
on Miss Assing to try and borrow the book from
Varnhagen. He does not possess it, so G. called on
Vehse, and asked him to lend it to me. He was very
much pleased to do so. Read the "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zueignung</span>," the
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gedichte</span>," and several of the ballads. Looked
through Wraxall's "Memoirs." Read Macaulay's
"History of England." Wrote article on Stahr.</p>

<blockquote><p>This writing and reading, combined with visiting,
theatre-going, and opera-going, make a pretty full
life for these eight months&mdash;a striking contrast to
the coming months of complete social quietness in
England. Both lives had their attractions, the superficial
aspects of which may be summed up in a
passage from the Journal, dated 13th March, 1855,
on arrival at the Lord Warden Hotel, at Dover:</p></blockquote>

<p>English mutton and an English fire were likely to be appreciated
by creatures who had had eight months of
Germany, with its questionable meat and its stove-heated
rooms. The taste and quietude of a first-rate English
hotel were also in striking contrast with the heavy
finery, the noise, and the indiscriminate smoking of
German inns. But, after all, Germany is no bad place
to live in; and the Germans, to counterbalance their
want of taste and politeness, are at least free from the
bigotry of exclusiveness of their more refined cousins.
I even long to be among them again&mdash;to see Dresden
and Munich and Nürnberg and the Rhine country.
May the day soon come!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Journal,
Mch. 1855.</div>

<p><i>March 14.</i>&mdash;Took lodgings at 1 Sydney Place, Dover.</p>

<p><i>March 15.</i>&mdash;A lovely day. As I walked up the Castle
hill this afternoon the town, with its background of
softly rounded hills shrouded in sleepy haze, its little
lines of water looking golden in the sun, made a charming
picture. I have written the preface to the Third
Book of "Ethics," read Scherr, and Shakespeare's "Venus
and Adonis."</p>

<p><i>March 16.</i>&mdash;I read Shakespeare's "Passionate Pilgrim"
at breakfast, and found a sonnet in which he
expresses admiration of Spenser (Sonnet viii.):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As, passing all conceit, needs no
defence."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I must send word of this to G., who has written in
his "Goethe" that Shakespeare has left no line in
praise of a contemporary. I could not resist the
temptation of walking out before I sat down to work.
Came in at half-past ten, and translated Spinoza till
nearly one. Walked out again till two. After dinner
read "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and some of the
"Sonnets." That play disgusted me more than ever
in the final scene, where Valentine, on Proteus's mere
begging pardon, when he has no longer any hope of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
gaining his ends, says: "All that was mine in Sylvia,
I give thee!" Silvia standing by. Walked up the Castle
hill again, and came in at six. Read Scherr, and
found an important hint that I have made a mistake in
a sentence of my article on "Austria" about the death
of Franz von Sickingen.</p>

<p>I dare say you will be surprised to see that I write
from Dover. We left Berlin on the 11th. I have
taken lodgings here for a little while, until Mr. Lewes
has concluded some arrangements in London; and,
with the aid of lovely weather, am even enjoying my
solitude, though I don't mind how soon it ends. News
of you all at Rosehill&mdash;how health and business and
all other things are faring&mdash;would be very welcome to
me, if you can find time for a little note of homely details.
I am well and calmly happy&mdash;feeling much
stronger and clearer in mind for the last eight months
of new experience. We were sorry to leave our quiet
rooms and agreeable friends in Berlin, though the
place itself is certainly ugly, and <i>am Ende</i> must become
terribly wearisome for those who have not a vocation
there. We went again and again to the new
museum to look at the casts of the Parthenon Sculptures,
and registered a vow that we would go to feast
on the sight of the originals the first day we could
spare in London. I had never cast more than a fleeting
look on them before, but now I can in some degree
understand the effect they produced on their first
discovery.</p>

<p>I have good hope that you will be deeply interested
in the "Life of Goethe." It is a book full of feeling,
as well as of thought and information, and I even think
will make you love Goethe as well as admire him.
Eckermann's is a wonderful book, but only represents
Goethe at eighty. We were fortunate enough to be in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
time to see poor Eckermann before his <em>total</em> death.
His mind was already half gone, but the fine brow
and eyes harmonized entirely with the interest we had
previously felt in him. We saw him in a small lodging,
surrounded by singing birds, and tended by his
son&mdash;an intelligent youth of sixteen, who showed some
talent in drawing. I have written a castigation of
Brougham for the <cite>Leader</cite>, and shall be glad if your
sympathy goes along with it. Varnhagen has written
"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Denkwurdigkeiten</span>," and all sorts of literature, and
is, or, rather was, the husband of <i>Rahel</i>, the greatest of
German women.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Miss Sara
Hennell,
21st July,
1855.</div>

<p>It was surely you who wrote the notice of the <cite>Westminster</cite>
in the <cite>Herald</cite> (Coventry) which we received
this morning. I am very much pleased with your appreciation
of Mr. Lewes's article. You hardly do justice
to Froude's article on "Spinoza." I don't at all
agree with Froude's own views, but I think his account
of Spinoza's doctrines admirable. Mr. Lewes
is still sadly ailing&mdash;tormented with tooth and face
ache. This is a terrible trial to us poor scribblers, to
whom health is money, as well as all other things
worth having. I have just been reading that Milton
suffered from indigestion&mdash;quite an affecting fact to
me. I send you a letter which I have had from Barbara
Smith. I think you will like to see such a manifestation
of her strong, noble nature.</p>

<blockquote><p>On 1st August, 1855, Mr. Lewes went down to
Ramsgate for change, taking his three boys with
him for a week's holiday. Meantime George Eliot
was continuing her article-writing, and in this week
wrote an article for the <cite>Leader</cite>, having written one
for the same journal three weeks before. On 22d
August she wrote another article for the <cite>Leader</cite>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and on the 24th she finished the one on Cumming
for the <cite>Westminster</cite>. Mr. C. Lewes tells me that
he remembers it was after reading this article that
his father was prompted to say to George Eliot,
while walking one day with her in Richmond Park,
that it convinced him of the true genius in her writing.
Mr. Lewes was not only an accomplished and
practised literary critic, but he was also gifted with
the inborn insight accompanying a fine artistic
temperament, which gave unusual weight to his
judgment. Up to this time he had not been quite
sure of anything beyond great talent in her productions.</p>

<p>The first three weeks in September were again
busily occupied in article-writing. She contributed
three papers to the <cite>Leader</cite>, as well as the Belles-lettres
section for the October number of the <cite>Westminster</cite>.
On the 19th September they left East
Sheen, and after spending a couple of weeks at
Worthing for a sea change, they took rooms at 8
Park Shot, Richmond, which remained their home
for more than three years. Here some of George
Eliot's most memorable literary work was accomplished.
Both she and Mr. Lewes were now working
very hard for what would bring immediate
profit, as they had to support not only themselves
but his children and their mother. They had only
one sitting-room between them; and I remember, in
a walk on St. George's Hill, near Weybridge, in 1871,
she told me that the scratching of another pen used
to affect her nerves to such an extent that it nearly
drove her wild. On the 9th October she finished an
article on Margaret Fuller and Mary Wollstonecraft,
and on the 12th October one on Carlyle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
for the <cite>Leader</cite>, and began an article on Heine for
the January number of the <cite>Westminster</cite>. In October
there are the following letters to the Brays:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Since you have found out the "Cumming," I write by
to-day's post just to say that it <em>is</em> mine, but also to beg
that you will not mention it as such to any one likely
to transmit the information to London, as we are keeping
the authorship a secret. The article appears to
have produced a strong impression, and that impression
would be a little counteracted if the author were known
to be a <em>woman</em>. I have had a letter addressed "to the
author of Article No. 4," begging me to print it separately
"for the good of mankind in general!" It is
so kind of you to rejoice in anything I do at all well.
I am dreadfully busy again, for I am going to write an
article for the <cite>Westminster Review</cite> again, besides my
other work. We enjoy our new lodgings very much&mdash;everything
is the pink of order and cleanliness.</p>

<p>Why you should object to Herbert Spencer speaking
of Sir William Hamilton's contributions to a theory
of perception as "valuable" I am unable to conceive.
Sir William Hamilton has been of service to him as
well as to others; and instead of repressing acknowledgments
of merit in others, I should like them to be
more freely given. I see no dignity, or anything else
that is good, in ignoring one's fellow-beings. Herbert
Spencer's views, like every other man's views, could
not have existed without the substratum laid by his
predecessors. But perhaps you mean something that
I fail to perceive. Your bit of theology is very fine.
Here is a delicious Hibernicism in return. In a treatise
on consumption, sent yesterday, the writer says:
"There is now hardly any <em>difference</em> on this subject&mdash;at
least <em>I</em> feel none." Our life has no incidents except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
such as take place in our own brains, and the occasional
arrival of a longer letter than usual. Yours
are always read aloud and enjoyed. Nevertheless our
life is intensely occupied, and the days are far too
short. We are reading Gall's "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anatomie et Physiologie
du Cerveau,</span>" and Carpenter's "Comparative
Physiology," aloud in the evenings; and I am trying
to fix some knowledge about plexuses and ganglia in
my soft brain, which generally only serves me to remember
that there is something I ought to remember,
and to regret that I did not put the something down
in my note-book. For "Live and learn," we should
sometimes read "Live and grow stupid."</p>

<p>You will receive by rail to-morrow a copy of the
"Life and Works of Goethe" (published on 1st November),
which I hope you will accept as a keepsake
from me. I should have been glad to send it you earlier,
but as Mr. Lewes has sold the copyright of the
first edition, he has only a small number of copies at
his disposal, and so I doubted whether I ought to ask
for one. I think you will find much to interest you in
the book. I can't tell you how I value it, as the best
product of a mind which I have every day more reason
to admire and love. We have had much gratification
in the expression of individual opinion. The press is
very favorable, but the notices are for the most part
too idiotic to give us much pleasure, except in a pecuniary

in less than three months for a thirty-shilling book.
We have a charming collection of letters, both from
remarkable acquaintances and remarkable non-acquaintances,
expressing enthusiastic delight in the

quite spontaneous, and spring from a generous wish to

<p>I was so glad to have a little news of you. I should
like to hear much oftener, but our days are so accurately
parcelled out among regular occupations that I
rarely manage to do anything not included in the programme;
and, without reading Mrs. Barbauld on the
"Inconsistency of Human Expectations," I know that
receiving letters is inconsistent with not writing any.
Have you seen any numbers of the <cite>Saturday Review</cite>,
a new journal, on which "all the talents" are engaged?
It is not properly a newspaper, but&mdash;what its title expresses&mdash;a
political and literary review. We are delighting
ourselves with Ruskin's third volume, which
contains some of the finest writing I have read for a
long time (among recent books). I read it aloud for
an hour or so after dinner; then we jump to the old
dramatists, when Mr. Lewes reads to me as long as his
voice will hold out, and after this we wind up the evening
with Rymer Jones's "Animal Kingdom," by which
I get a confused knowledge of branchiæ, and such
things&mdash;perhaps, on the whole, a little preferable to
total ignorance. These are our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noctes</i>&mdash;without <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cenæ</i>

singing of Figaro, etc., which, I think, must
alarm "that good man, the clergyman," who sits below
us. We have been half laughing, half indignant, over
Alison's new volume of his "History of Europe," in

<p>What you tell me of Harriet Martineau interests me
very much. I feel for her terrible bodily suffering,
and think of her with deep respect and admiration.
Whatever may have been her mistakes and weaknesses,
the great and good things she has done far outweigh
them; and I should be grieved if anything in her memoir
should cast a momentary shadow over the agreeable
image of her that the world will ultimately keep
in its memory. I wish less of our piety were spent on
imaginary perfect goodness, and more given to real
<em>im</em>perfect goodness.</p>

<p>I am very happy for you to keep the sheets, and to
get signatures (for the Women's Petition that they
should have legal right to their own earnings). Miss
Barbara Smith writes that she must have them returned
to her before the 1st of March. I am glad you
have taken up the cause, for I do think that, with
proper provisos and safeguards, the proposed law
would help to raise the position and character of women.
It is one round of a long ladder stretching far
beyond our lives.</p>

<p>We are flourishing in every way except in health. Mr.
Lewes's head is still infirm, but he manages, nevertheless,
to do twice as much work as other people. I am
always a croaker, you know, but my ailments are of a
small kind, their chief symptoms being a muddled
brain; and, as my pen is not of the true literary order
which will run along without the help of brains, I don't
get through so much work as I should like. By the
way, when the Spinoza comes out, be so good as not
to mention my name in connection with it. I particularly
wish not to be known as the translator of the
"Ethics," for reasons which it would be "too tedious
to mention." You don't know what a severely practical
person I am become, and what a sharp eye I have
to the main chance. I keep the purse, and dole out
sovereigns with all the pangs of a miser. In fact, if
you were to feel my bump of acquisitiveness, I dare
say you would find it in a state of inflammation, like
the "veneration" of that clergyman to whom Mr. Donovan
said, "Sir, you have recently been engaged in
prayer." I hope you recognized your own wit about
the one-eyed dissenters, which was quoted in the

I know the trip up the Thames is charming, and we
should like to do it with you, but I don't think we can
manage it this summer. We are going to send or take
the boys (Mr. Lewes's sons) to school in Germany at
midsummer, and are at present uncertain about our
arrangements. If we can <em>send</em> them, we shall go to the
coast as soon as the warm weather comes, and remain
there for three months. But our plans are not yet
crystallized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>After I wrote you yesterday morning we had a letter
from Germany which has made Mr. Lewes incline to
defer sending the boys thither till next year. But he
is anxious to remove them from their present school:
and, in the course of our consultations on the subject,
we thought of Mr. John Sibree as a person in whom
we should feel confidence as to the moral influence he
would exercise as a tutor. The risk of placing children
with entire strangers is terrible. So I tease you
with another letter to ask you if Mr. J. Sibree continues
in the same position as formerly, and if he is still
anxious to obtain pupils. What a delicious day! We
are going to have a holiday at the Zoological Gardens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Thank you for taking the trouble to write me a full
account of matters so interesting to me. I hope you
will be able thoroughly to enjoy this last precious summer
on the pretty lawn, where it is one of my pleasures
on sunshiny days to think of you all strolling about or
seated on the Bearskin. We are very thankful for the
Hofwyl circular, and have almost decided to send the
two eldest boys there. But it is necessary to weigh all
things carefully before coming to a determination; as,
not being either swindlers or philanthropists, we don't
like to incur obligations which there is not a reasonable
certainty of our being able to meet. I am much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
obliged to Mr. Bray, too, for sending Mr. John Sibree's
letter. Mr. Lewes had already received an answer
from him declining his proposition, but we were interested
to read his very characteristic letter to his
sister, which proved to Mr. Lewes that I had given
him a correct description of the man.</p>

<blockquote><p>The next few weeks are, perhaps, the most signally

who had been abroad for some time, returned to
England, and dined with them at Park Shot on the
15th, and on the 18th they went with him to Sydenham.

article for the <cite>Westminster</cite>. On the 8th of May
they set off for Ilfracombe, and we have the following
"recollections" of that place:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Ilfracombe,

<p>It was a cold, unfriendly day&mdash;the 8th of May&mdash;on
which we set out for Ilfracombe with our hamper of
glass jars, which we meant for our sea-side vivarium.
We had to get down at Windsor, and were not sorry
that the interval was long enough to let us walk round
the castle, which I had never seen before except from
a distance. The famous "slopes," the avenues in the
park, and the distant landscape, looked very lovely in
the fresh and delicate greens of spring; and the castle
is surely the most delightful royal residence in the
world. We took our places from Windsor all the way
to Exeter; and at Bristol, where we had to wait three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
hours, the misery of my terrible headache was mitigated
by the interest we felt in seeing the grand old
Church of St. Mary Redcliffe, forever associated with
the memory of Chatterton.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It stands, the maestrie of a human hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pride of Bristowe and the western land."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was cheering, the next morning after our arrival at
Ilfracombe, to get up with a head rather less aching,
and to walk up and down the little garden of Runnymede
Villa in the bright sunshine. I had a great deal
of work before me&mdash;the writing of an article on Riehl's
book, which I had not half read, as well as the article
on Belles-lettres; but my head was still dizzy, and
it seemed impossible to sit down to writing at once in
these new scenes, so we determined to spend the day
in explorations.</p>

<p>From our windows we had a view of the higher
part of the town, and generally it looked uninteresting
enough; but what is it that light cannot transfigure into
beauty? One evening, after a shower, as the sun was
setting over the sea behind us, some peculiar arrangement
of clouds threw a delicious evening light on the
irregular cluster of houses, and merged the ugliness of
their forms in an exquisite flood of color&mdash;as a stupid
person is made glorious by a noble deed. A perfect
rainbow arched over the picture. From one end of
the Capstone we have an admirable bit for a picture.
In the background rises old Helesborough, jutting out
far into the sea&mdash;rugged and rocky as it fronts the
waves, green and accessible landward; in front of this
stands Lantern Hill, a picturesque mass of green and
gray, surmounted by an old bit of building that looks
as if it were the habitation of some mollusk that had
secreted its shell from the material of the rock; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
quite in the foreground, contrasting finely in color with
the rest, are some lower perpendicular rocks of dark-brown
tints, patched here and there with vivid green.
In hilly districts, where houses and clusters of houses
look so tiny against the huge limbs of mother earth,
one cannot help thinking of man as a parasitic animal&mdash;an
epizoan making his abode in the skin of the
planetary organism. In a flat country, a house or a
town looks imposing; there is nothing to rival it in
height, and we may imagine the earth a mere pedestal
for us. But when one sees a house stuck on the side
of a great hill, and, still more, a number of houses, looking
like a few barnacles, clustered on the side of a great
rock, we begin to think of the strong family likeness
between ourselves and all other building, burrowing,
house-appropriating, and shell-secreting animals. The
difference between a man with his house and a mollusk
with its shell lies in the number of steps or phenomena
interposed between the fact of individual existence
and the completion of the building. Whatever other
advantages we may have over mollusks and insects in
our habitations, it is clear that their architecture has
the advantage of ours in beauty&mdash;at least, considered
as the architecture of the species. Look at man in the
light of a shell-fish, and it must be admitted that his
shell is generally ugly; and it is only after a great
many more "steps or phenomena" that he secretes
here and there a wonderful shell in the shape of a
temple or a palace.</p>

<p>On our first zoophyte hunt it was characteristic of
the wide difference there is between having eyes and
<em>seeing</em>, that in this region of sea-anemones, where the
Mesembryanthemum especially is as plenty as blackberries,
we climbed about for two hours without seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
one anemone, and went in again with scarcely anything
but a few stones and weeds to put into our jars. On
our next hunt, however, after we had been out some
time, G. exclaimed, "I see an anemone!" and we
were immensely excited by the discovery of this little
red Mesembryanthemum, which we afterwards disdained
to gather, as much as if it had been a nettle.
It was a <i>crescendo</i> of delight when we found a "strawberry,"
and a <i>fortissimo</i> when I, for the first time, saw
the pale, fawn-colored tentacles of an <i>Anthea cereus</i>
viciously waving like little serpents in a low-tide pool.
But not a polype for a long, long while could even G.
detect, after all his reading; so necessary is it for the
eye to be educated by objects as well as ideas. Every
day I gleaned some little bit of naturalistic experience,
either through G.'s calling on me to look through the
microscope, or from hunting on the rocks; and this in
spite of my preoccupation with my article, which I
worked at considerably <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à contre-c&oelig;ur</i>, despairing of it
ever being worth anything. When at last, by the 17th
of June, both my articles were despatched, I felt delightfully
at liberty, and determined to pay some attention
to seaweeds, which I had never seen in such
beauty as at Ilfracombe. For hitherto I had been
chiefly on chalky and sandy shores, where there were
no rock-pools to show off the lovely colors and forms
of the algæ. There are tide-pools to be seen almost
at every other step on the shore at Ilfracombe; and I
shall never forget their appearance when we first
arrived there. The <i>Corallina officinalis</i> was then in its
greatest perfection, and with its purple-pink fronds
threw into relief the dark olive fronds of the Laminariæ
on one side, and the vivid green of the Ulva and Enteromorpha
on the other. After we had been there a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
few weeks the Corallina was faded; and I noticed the
<i>Mesagloia vermicularis</i> and the <i>M. virescens</i>, which look
very lovely in the water, from the white cilia, which
make the most delicate fringe to their yellow-brown,
whip-like fronds, and some of the common Polysiphoniæ.
These tide-pools made me quite in love with
seaweeds, so I took up Landsborough's book and tried
to get a little more light on their structure and history.</p>

<p>Our zoological expeditions alternated with delicious
inland walks. I think the country looked its best
when we arrived. It was just that moment in spring
when the leaves are in full leaf, but still keep their
delicate varieties of coloring, and that <em>transparency</em>
which belongs only to this season. And the furze was
in all its golden glory! It was almost like the fading
away of the evening red, when the furze blossoms died
off from the hills, and the only contrast left was that
of the marly soil with the green crops and woods. The
primroses were the contemporaries of the furze, and
sprinkled the sides of the hills with their pale stars almost
as plentifully as daisies or buttercups elsewhere.
But the great charm of all Devonshire lanes is the
springs that you detect gurgling in shady recesses,
covered with liverwort, with here and there waving tufts
of fern and other broad-leaved plants that love obscurity
and moisture.</p>

<p>We seemed to make less of our evenings at Ilfracombe
than we have ever done elsewhere. We used
often to be tired with our hunting or walking; and we
were reading books which did not make us take them
up very eagerly&mdash;Gosse's "Rambles on the Devonshire
Coast," for example; Trench's "Calderon," and
other volumes, taken up in a desultory way. One bit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of reading we had there, however, which interested me
deeply. It was Masson's "Life of Chatterton," which
happily linked itself with the impressions I had received
from the sight of the old church at Bristol.</p>

<p>Mr. Tugwell's (the curate) acquaintance was a real
acquisition to us, not only because he was a companion
and helper in zoological pursuits, but because to know
him was to know of another sweet nature in the world.
It is always good to know, if only in passing, a charming
human being; it refreshes one like flowers and
woods and clear brooks. One Sunday evening we
walked up to his pretty house to carry back some
proofs of his, and he induced us to go in and have
coffee with him. He played on his harmonium, and
we chatted pleasantly. The last evening of our stay
at Ilfracombe he came to see us in Mrs. Webster's
drawing-room, and we had music till nearly eleven
o'clock&mdash;a pleasant recollection!</p>

<p>We only twice took the walk beyond Watermouth
towards Berrynarbor. The road lies through what are
called the "Meadows," which look like a magnificent
park. A stream, fringed with wild-flowers and willows,
runs along the valley, two or three yards from the side
of the road. This stream is clear as crystal, and about
every twenty yards it falls over a little artificial precipice
of stones. The long grass was waving in all the
glory of June, before the mower has come to make it
suffer a "love change" from beauties into sweet odors;
and the slopes on each side of us were crowned or
clothed with fine trees. The last time we went through
these meadows was on our last day at Ilfracombe.
Such sunlight and such deep peace on the hills and by
the stream! Coming back, we rested on a gate under
the trees, and a blind man came up to rest also. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
told us, in his slow way, what a fine, "healthy spot" this
was&mdash;yes, a very healthy spot&mdash;a healthy spot. And
then we went on our way, and saw his face no more.</p>

<p>I have talked of the Ilfracombe lanes without describing
them, for to describe them one ought to know
the names of all the lovely wild-flowers that cluster
on their banks. Almost every yard of these banks is
a "Hunt" picture&mdash;a delicious crowding of mosses
and delicate trefoil and wild strawberries and ferns
great and small. But the crowning beauty of the lanes
is the springs that gush out in little recesses by the
side of the road&mdash;recesses glossy with liverwort and
feathery with fern. Sometimes you have the spring
when it has grown into a brook, either rushing down a
miniature cataract by the lane-side, or flowing gently
as a "braided streamlet" across your path. I never
before longed so much to know the names of things as
during this visit to Ilfracombe. The desire is part of
the tendency that is now constantly growing in me to
escape from all vagueness and inaccuracy into the daylight
of distinct, vivid ideas. The mere fact of naming
an object tends to give definiteness to our conception
of it. We have then a sign which at once calls up in
our minds the distinctive qualities which mark out for
us that particular object from all others.</p>

<p>We ascended the Tors only twice; for a tax of 3<i>d.</i>
per head was demanded on this luxury, and we could
not afford a sixpenny walk very frequently: yet the view
is perhaps the very finest to be had at Ilfracombe.
Bay behind bay, fringed with foam, and promontory
behind promontory, each with its peculiar shades of
purple light&mdash;the sweep of the Welsh coast faintly visible
in the distance, and the endless expanse of sea,
flecked with ships, stretching on our left.

<div class="sidenote">Ilfracombe,
Recollections,

<p>One evening we went down to the shore through
the "Tunnels" to see the sunset. Standing in the
"Ladies' Cove," we had before us the sharp fragments
of rock jutting out of the waves and standing black
against the orange and crimson sky. How lovely to
look into that brilliant distance and see the ship on
the horizon seeming to sail away from the cold and
dim world behind it right into the golden glory! I
have always that sort of feeling when I look at sunset;
it always seems to me that there in the West lies a
land of light and warmth and love.</p>

<p>On the 26th of June we said good-bye to Ilfracombe.
The sight of the cockle-women at Swansea, where we
had to wait, would make a fine subject for a painter.
One of them was the grandest woman I ever saw&mdash;six
feet high, carrying herself like a Greek warrior, and
treading the earth with unconscious majesty. Her
face was weather-beaten and wizened, but her eyes
were bright and piercing, and the lines of her face,
with its high cheek-bones, strong and characteristic.
The guard at the railway station told us that one of
the porters had been insolent the other day to a cockle-woman,
and that she immediately pitched him off
the platform into the road below!</p>

<p>When we arrived here I had not even read a great
book on which I had engaged to write a long article
by the beginning of this month; so that between work
and zoology and bodily ailments my time has been full
to overflowing. We are enchanted with Ilfracombe. I
really think it is the loveliest sea-place I ever saw, from
the combination of fine rocky coast with exquisite inland
scenery. But it would not do for any one who
can't climb rocks and mount perpetual hills; for the
peculiarity of this country is, that it is all hill and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
valley. You have no sooner got to the foot of one
hill than you begin to mount another. You would
laugh to see our room decked with yellow pie-dishes,
a <i>foot-pan</i>, glass jars and phials, all full of zoophytes,
or mollusks, or anellides&mdash;and, still more, to see the
eager interest with which we rush to our "preserves"
in the morning to see if there has been any mortality
among them in the night. We have made the acquaintance
of a charming little zoological curate here, who
is a delightful companion on expeditions, and is most
good-natured in lending and giving apparatus and
"critturs" of all sorts. Mr.
Pigott<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
is coming here with
his yacht at the end of June, and we hope then to go
to Clovelly&mdash;Kingsley's Clovelly&mdash;and perhaps other
places on the coast that we can't reach on foot. After
this we mean to migrate to Tenby, for the sake of making
acquaintance with its mollusks and medusæ.</p>

<p>I received your kind letter only yesterday, but I write
a few words in answer at once, lest, as it so often happens,
delay should beget delay.</p>

<p>It is never too late to write generous words, and
although circumstances are not likely to allow of our
acquiring a more intimate knowledge of each other
from personal intercourse, it will always be a pleasant
thought to me that you have remembered me kindly,
and interpreted me nobly. You are one of the minority
who know how to "use their imagination in the
service of charity."</p>

<p>I have suffered so much from misunderstanding created
by letters, even to old friends, that I never write
on private personal matters, unless it be a rigorous
duty or necessity to do so. Some little phrase or allusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
is misinterpreted, and on this false basis a great
fabric of misconception is reared, which even explanatory
conversations will not remove. Life is too precious
to be spent in this weaving and unweaving of false
impressions, and it is better to live quietly on under
some degree of misrepresentation than to attempt to
remove it by the uncertain process of letter-writing.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, I do remember old Tenby days, and
had set my heart on being in the very same house
again; but, alas! it had just been let. It is immensely
smartened up, like the place generally, since those
old times, and is proportionately less desirable for
quiet people who have no flounces and do not subscribe
to new churches. Tenby looks insignificant in picturesqueness
after Ilfracombe; but the two objects that
drew us hither, zoology and health, will flourish none
the worse for the absence of tall precipices and many-tinted
rocks. The air is delicious&mdash;soft, but not sultry&mdash;and
the sands and bathing such as are to be found
nowhere else. St. Catherine's Rock, with its caverns,
is our paradise. We go there with baskets, hammers
and chisels, and jars and phials, and come home laden
with spoils. Altogether, we are contented to have been
driven away from Ilfracombe by the cold wind, since a
new place is new experience, and Mr. Lewes has never
been here before. To me there is the additional pleasure&mdash;half
melancholy&mdash;of recalling all the old impressions
and comparing them with the new. I understand
your wish to have as much of Rosehill as possible
this year, and I am so glad that you will associate
a visit from Herbert Spencer with this last summer. I
suppose he is with you now. If so, give him my very
evil regards, and tell him that because he has not written
to us we will diligently <em>not</em> tell him a great many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
things he would have liked to know. We have a project
of going into St. Catherine's caverns with lanterns,
some night when the tide is low, about eleven, for
the sake of seeing the zoophytes preparing for their
midnight revels. The Actiniæ, like other belles, put
on their best faces on such occasions. Two things
we have lost by leaving Ilfracombe for which we have
no compensation&mdash;the little zoological curate, Mr. Tugwell,
who is really one of the best specimens of the
clergyman species I have seen; and the pleasure of
having Miss Barbara Smith there for a week, sketching
the rocks, and putting our love of them into the tangible
form of a picture. We are looking out now for Mr.
Pigott in his yacht; and his amiable face will make an
agreeable variety on the sands. I thought
"Walden"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>

for its bits of description. It is pleasant to think that
Harriet Martineau can make so much of her last days.
Her energy and her habit of useful work are admirable.</p>

much literary work was done, except the articles
on Young and on Riehl's book. There was a

a review for the <cite>Leader</cite>. There is mention, too,

my being able to show much result for it. I have
written a review of the "Lover's Seat," and jotted down
some recollections of Ilfracombe; besides these trifles,
and the introduction to an article already written, I
have done no <em>visible</em> work. But I have absorbed many
ideas and much bodily strength; indeed, I do not remember
ever feeling so strong in mind and body as I
feel at this moment. On Saturday, the 12th, Barbara
Smith arrived, and stayed here till Wednesday morning.
We enjoyed her society very much, but were
deeply touched to see that three years had made her
so much older and sadder. Her activity for great objects
is admirable; and contact with her is a fresh inspiration
to work while it is day. We have now taken
up Quatrefages again. The "Memoirs" of Beaumarchais
yielded me little fruit. Mr. Chapman invites
me to contribute to the <cite>Westminster</cite> for this quarter.

Mr. Pigott is with us just now, and we are meditating

him. Our visit to Tenby has been very useful zoologically,
but we are not otherwise greatly in love with the
place. It seems tame and vulgar after Ilfracombe.

We want people to feel with us more than to act for

G. of my novel. Finished 'César Birotteau' aloud."
On the 25th August Mr. Lewes set off for Hofwyl,
near Berne, taking his two eldest boys, Charles and
Thornton, to place them at school there. He returned
on 4th September, and in his absence George

<p>We have now arrived at the period of the new

it came about:</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How I
came to
write
fiction.</div>

<p>September, 1856, made a new era in my life, for it was
then I began to write fiction. It had always been a
vague dream of mine that some time or other I might
write a novel; and my shadowy conception of what
the novel was to be, varied, of course, from one epoch
of my life to another. But I never went further towards
the actual writing of the novel than an introductory
chapter describing a Staffordshire village and the
life of the neighboring farm-houses; and as the years
passed on I lost any hope that I should ever be able
to write a novel, just as I desponded about everything
else in my future life. I always thought I was deficient
in dramatic power, both of construction and dialogue,
but I felt I should be at my ease in the descriptive
parts of a novel. My "introductory chapter" was
pure description, though there were good materials in
it for dramatic presentation. It happened to be among
the papers I had with me in Germany, and one evening
at Berlin something led me to read it to George.
He was struck with it as a bit of concrete description,
and it suggested to him the possibility of my being
able to write a novel, though he distrusted&mdash;indeed,
disbelieved in&mdash;my possession of any dramatic power.
Still, he began to think that I might as well try some
time what I could do in fiction, and by and by, when
we came back to England, and I had greater success
than he ever expected in other kinds of writing, his
impression that it was worth while to see how far my
mental power would go towards the production of a
novel, was strengthened. He began to say very positively,
"You must try and write a story," and when
we were at Tenby he urged me to begin at once. I
deferred it, however, after my usual fashion with work
that does not present itself as an absolute duty. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
one morning, as I was thinking what should be the
subject of my first story, my thoughts merged themselves
into a dreamy doze, and I imagined myself writing
a story, of which the title was "The Sad Fortunes
of the Reverend Amos Barton." I was soon wide
awake again and told G. He said, "Oh, what a capital
title!" and from that time I had settled in my mind
that this should be my first story. George used to
say, "It may be a failure&mdash;it may be that you are unable
to write fiction. Or, perhaps, it may be just good
enough to warrant your trying again." Again, "You
may write a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> at once&mdash;there's no telling."
But his prevalent impression was, that though I could
hardly write a <em>poor</em> novel, my effort would want the
highest quality of fiction&mdash;dramatic presentation. He
used to say, "You have wit, description, and philosophy&mdash;those
go a good way towards the production of
a novel. It is worth while for you to try the experiment."</p>

<p>We determined that if my story turned out good
enough we would send it to Blackwood; but G. thought
the more probable result was that I should have to lay
it aside and try again.</p>

<p>But when we returned to Richmond I had to write
my article on "Silly Novels," and my review of Contemporary
Literature for the <cite>Westminster</cite>, so that I did
not begin my story till September 22. After I had begun
it, as we were walking in the park, I mentioned to
G. that I had thought of the plan of writing a series of
stories, containing sketches drawn from my own observation
of the clergy, and calling them "Scenes from
Clerical Life," opening with "Amos Barton." He at
once accepted the notion as a good one&mdash;fresh and
striking; and about a week afterwards, when I read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
him the first part of "Amos," he had no longer any
doubt about my ability to carry out the plan. The
scene at Cross Farm, he said, satisfied him that I had
the very element he had been doubtful about&mdash;it was
clear I could write good dialogue. There still remained
the question whether I could command any pathos;
and that was to be decided by the mode in which I
treated Milly's death. One night G. went to town on
purpose to leave me a quiet evening for writing it. I
wrote the chapter from the news brought by the shepherd
to Mrs. Hackit, to the moment when Amos is
dragged from the bedside, and I read it to G. when he
came home. We both cried over it, and then he came
up to me and kissed me, saying, "I think your pathos
is better than your fun."</p>

<blockquote><p>The story of the "Sad Fortunes of Amos Barton"
was begun on 22d September and finished
on the 5th November, and I subjoin the opening
correspondence between Mr. Lewes and Mr. John
Blackwood, to exhibit the first effect it produced:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"I trouble you with a MS. of 'Sketches of Clerical
Life' which was submitted to me by a friend
who desired my good offices with you. It goes by
this post. I confess that before reading the MS. I
had considerable doubts of my friend's powers as
a writer of fiction; but, after reading it, these doubts
were changed into very high admiration. I don't
know what you will think of the story, but, according
to my judgment, such humor, pathos, vivid presentation,
and nice observation have not been exhibited
(in this style) since the 'Vicar of Wakefield;'
and, in consequence of that opinion, I feel
quite pleased in negotiating the matter with you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is what I am commissioned to say to you
about the proposed series. It will consist of tales
and sketches illustrative of the actual life of our
country clergy about a quarter of a century ago&mdash;but
solely in its <em>human</em>, and not at all in its <em>theological</em>
aspects; the object being to do what has never
yet been done in our literature, for we have had
abundant religious stories, polemical and doctrinal,
but since the 'Vicar' and Miss Austen, no stories
representing the clergy like every other class, with
the humors, sorrows, and troubles of other men.
He begged me particularly to add, that&mdash;as the
specimen sent will sufficiently prove&mdash;the tone
throughout will be sympathetic, and not at all antagonistic.</p>

<p>"Some of these, if not all, you may think suitable
for 'Maga.' If any are sent of which you
do not approve, or which you do not think sufficiently
interesting, these he will reserve for the
separate republication, and for this purpose he
wishes to retain the copyright. Should you only
print one or two, he will be well satisfied; and still
better, if you should think well enough of the series
to undertake the separate republication."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"I am happy to say that I think your friend's
reminiscences of Clerical Life will do. If there is
any more of the series written I should like to see
it, as, until I saw more, I could not make any decided
proposition for the publication of the tales,
in whole or in part, in the Magazine. This first
specimen, 'Amos Barton,' is unquestionably very
pleasant reading. Perhaps the author falls into
the error of trying too much to explain the characters
of his actors by description instead of allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
them to evolve in the action of the story; but the
descriptions are very humorous and good. The
death of Milly is powerfully done, and affected me
much. I am not sure whether he does not spoil it
a little by specifying so minutely the different children
and their names. The wind-up is perhaps the
lamest part of the story; and there, too, I think the
defect is caused by the specifications as to the fortunes
of parties of whom the reader has no previous
knowledge, and cannot, consequently, feel much interest.
At first, I was afraid that in the amusing
reminiscences of childhood in church there was a
want of some softening touch, such as the remembrance
of a father or mother lends, in after-years, to
what was at the time considerable penance.</p>

<p>"I hate anything of a sneer at real religious feeling
as cordially as I despise anything like cant, and
I should think this author is of the same way of
thinking, although his clergymen, with one exception,
are not very attractive specimens of the body.
The revulsion of feeling towards poor Amos is capitally
drawn, although the asinine stupidity of his
conduct about the countess had disposed one to
kick him.</p>

<p>"I dare say I shall have a more decided opinion
as to the merits of the story when I have looked
at it again and thought over it; but in the meantime
I am sure that there is a happy turn of expression
throughout, also much humor and pathos. If
the author is a new writer, I beg to congratulate
him on being worthy of the honors of print and
pay. I shall be very glad to hear from you or him
soon."</p></blockquote>

compelled <em>seriously to act</em> whenever they expressed
an opinion. Although not much given to
hesitate about anything, I always think twice before
I put the decisive mark 'In type for the Magazine'

of them. I am very sanguine that I will approve,
as, in addition to the other merits of 'Amos,' I agree
with you that there is great freshness of style. If
you think also that it would stimulate the author to
go on with the other tales with more spirit, I will
publish 'Amos' at once. He could divide into two
parts. I am blocked up for December, but I could

confidence of my friend, who is unusually sensitive,
and, unlike most writers, is more anxious about <em>excellence</em>

so long before taking the venture proves. He
is consequently afraid of failure, though not afraid
of obscurity; and by failure he would understand
that which I suspect most writers would be apt to
consider as success&mdash;so high is his ambition.</p>

about committing yourself to a series; and your
last letter has proved me to have been right&mdash;although,
as he never contemplated binding you to
the publication of any portion of the series to which
you might object, he could not at first see your position
in its true light.</p>

<p>"All is, however, clear now. He will be gratified
if you publish 'Amos Barton' in January, as it will
give him ample time to get the second story ready,
so as to appear when 'Barton' is finished, should
you wish it. He is anxious, however, that you
should publish the general title of 'Scenes of Clerical
Life;' and I think you may do this with perfect
safety, since it is quite clear that the writer of
'Amos Barton' is capable of writing at least one
more story suitable to 'Maga;' and two would suffice
to justify the general title.</p>

<p>"Let me not forget to add that when I referred
to 'my clerical friend,' I meant to designate the
writer of the clerical stories&mdash;not that he was a

<p>"Those who have seen the tale here are chiefly
members of my own family, and they are all enthusiastic
in praise.</p>

<p>"You may recollect that I expressed a fear that
in the affecting and highly wrought scene of poor
Milly's death, the attempt to individualize the children
by reiterating their names weakened the effect,
as the reader had not been prepared to care for
them individually, but simply as a group&mdash;the children
of Milly and the sorrow-stricken curate. My
brother says, 'No. Do not advise the author to
touch anything so exquisite.' Of course you are
the best judge.</p>

<p>"I now send proof of the conclusion of 'Amos,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>'
in acknowledgment of which, and of the first part,
I have the pleasure of enclosing a check for £52 10<i>s.</i>&mdash;fifty
guineas.</p>

<p>"If the series goes on as I anticipate, there is
every prospect that a republication as a separate
book, at some time or other, will be advisable. We
would look upon such republication as a joint
property, and would either give you a sum for your
interest in it, or publish on the terms of one half of
the clear profits, to be divided between author and
publisher, as might be most agreeable to you.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to hear from you, either
direct or through Mr. Lewes; and any intelligence
that the successors of 'Amos' are taking form and
substance will be very acceptable.</p>

<p>"I shall let you know what the other contributors
and the public think of 'Amos' as far as I can
gather a verdict, but in the meantime I may congratulate
you on having achieved a preliminary success
at all events."</p></blockquote>

<p>Your letter has proved to me that the generous editor
and publisher&mdash;generous both in word and in deed&mdash;who
makes the author's path smooth and easy, is something
more than a pleasant tradition. I am very sensitive
to the merits of checks for fifty guineas, but I
am still more sensitive to that cordial appreciation
which is a guarantee to me that my work was worth
doing for its own sake.</p>

<p>If the "Scenes of Clerical Life" should be republished,
I have no doubt we shall find it easy to arrange
the terms. In the meantime, the most pressing business
is to make them worth republishing.</p>

<p>I think the particularization of the children in the
deathbed scene has an important effect on the imagination.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
But I have removed all names from the "conclusion"
except those of Patty and Dickey, in whom,
I hope, the reader has a personal interest.</p>

<p>I hope to send you the second story by the beginning
of February. It will lie, for the most part, among
quite different scenes and persons from the last&mdash;opening
in Shepperton once more, but presently moving
away to a distant spot and new people, whom, I hope,
you will not like less than "Amos" and his friends.
But if any one of the succeeding stories should seem
to you unsuitable to the pages of "Maga," it can be reserved
for publication in the future volume, without
creating any difficulty.</p>

<p>Thank you very warmly for the hearty acceptance
you have given to my first story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,
1857.</div>

<p>The first part of "Amos Barton" appeared in the
January number of <cite>Blackwood</cite>. Before the appearance
of the Magazine, on sending me the proof, Mr. John
Blackwood already expressed himself with much greater
warmth of admiration; and when the first part had
appeared he sent me a charming letter, with a check
for fifty guineas, and a proposal about republication of
the series. When the story was concluded he wrote
me word how Albert Smith had sent him a letter saying
he had never read anything that affected him more
than Milly's death, and, added Blackwood, "The men
at the club seem to have mingled their tears and their
tumblers together. It will be curious if you should be
a member and be hearing your own praises." There
was clearly no suspicion that I was a woman. It is
interesting, as an indication of the value there is in
such conjectural criticism generally, to remember that
when G. read the first part of "Amos" to a party at
Helps's, they were all sure I was a clergyman&mdash;a Cambridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
man. Blackwood seemed curious about the
author, and, when I signed my letter "George Eliot,"
hunted up some old letters from Eliot Warburton's
brother to compare the handwritings, though, he said,
"'Amos' seems to me not in the least like what that
good artilleryman would write."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John

<p>Thank you for fulfilling your promise to let me know
something of the criticisms passed on my story. I
have a very moderate respect for "opinions of the
press," but the private opinions of intelligent people
may be valuable to me.</p>

<p>In reference to artistic presentation much adverse
opinion will, of course, arise from a dislike to the <em>order</em>
of art rather than from a critical estimate of the execution.
Any one who detests the Dutch school in
general will hardly appreciate fairly the merits of a
particular Dutch painting. And against this sort of
condemnation one must steel one's self as one best
can. But objections which point out to me any vice
of manner, or any failure in producing an intended effect,
will be really profitable. For example, I suppose my
scientific illustrations must be at fault, since they seem
to have obtruded themselves disagreeably on one of my
readers. But if it be a sin to be at once a man of science
and a writer of fiction, I can declare my perfect
innocence on that head, my scientific knowledge being
as superficial as that of the most "practised writers."
I hope to send you a second story in a few days, but I
am rather behindhand this time, having been prevented
from setting to work for some weeks by other business.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the success of my stories, I shall
be resolute in preserving my <i>incognito</i>, having observed
that a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</i> secures all the advantages without
the disagreeables of reputation. Perhaps, therefore, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
will be well to give you my prospective name, as a tub
to throw to the whale in case of curious inquiries; and
accordingly I subscribe myself, best and most sympathizing
of editors, yours very truly, <span class="smcap">George Eliot</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I may mention here that my wife told me the
reason she fixed on this name was that George was
Mr. Lewes's Christian name, and Eliot was a good,
mouth-filling, easily pronounced word.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>First let me thank you very heartily for your letter
of the 10th. Except your own very cordial appreciation,
which is so much beyond a mere official acceptance,
that little fact about Albert Smith has gratified
me more than anything else in connection with the
effect of "Amos." If you should happen to hear an
opinion from Thackeray, good or bad, I should like to
know it.</p>

<p>You will see that I have availed myself of your suggestions
on points of language. I quite recognize the
justice of your criticisms on the French phrases. They
are not in keeping with my story.</p>

<p>But I am unable to alter anything in relation to the
delineation or development of character, as my stories
always grow out of my psychological conception of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>. For example, the behavior of Caterina
in the gallery is essential to my conception of her
nature, and to the development of that nature in the
plot. My artistic bent is directed not at all to the
presentation of eminently irreproachable characters,
but to the presentation of mixed human beings in such
a way as to call forth tolerant judgment, pity, and sympathy.
And I cannot stir a step aside from what I
<em>feel</em> to be <em>true</em> in character. If anything strikes you
as untrue to human nature in my delineations, I shall
be very glad if you will point it out to me, that I may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
reconsider the matter. But, alas! inconsistencies and
weaknesses are not untrue. I hope that your doubts
about the plot will be removed by the further development
of the story. Meanwhile, warmest thanks for
your encouraging letters.</p>

<p>I am the more inclined to think that I shall admire
your book because you are suspected of having given
undue preponderance to the Christian argument: for
I have a growing conviction that we may measure true
moral and intellectual culture by the comprehension
and veneration given to all forms of thought and feeling
which have influenced large masses of mankind&mdash;and
of all intolerance the intolerance calling itself
philosophical is the most odious to me.</p>

<p>Thank you for the copy of "Maga" and for the accompanying

yours.</p>

<p>I was particularly pleased with that extract you were
so good as to send me from Mr. Swayne's letter. Dear

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I began, oddly enough you will perhaps think, by reading
through the "Answers of Infidelity,"<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
those being
the most interesting parts of the book to me. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of your own passages I think very admirable&mdash;some
of them made me cry, which is always a sign of the
highest pleasure writing can give me. But in many of
the extracts, I think, Infidelity cuts a very poor figure.
Some are feeble, some <em>bad</em>, and terribly discrepant in
the tone of their thought and feeling from the passages
which come fresh from your own mind. The disadvantage
arising from the perpetual shifting of the point
of view is a disadvantage, I suppose, inseparable from
the plan, which I cannot admire or feel to be effective,
though I can imagine it may be a serviceable form of
presentation to some inquirers. The <em>execution</em> I do
admire. I think it shows very high and rare qualities
of mind&mdash;a self-discipline and largeness of thought
which are the highest result of culture. The "Objections
of Christianity," which I have also read, are excellently
put, and have an immense advantage over the
"Answers of Infidelity" in their greater homogeneity.
The first part I have only begun and glanced through,
and at present have no other observation to make than
that I think you might have brought a little more artillery
to bear on Christian morality. But nothing is
easier than to find fault&mdash;nothing so difficult as to <em>do</em>
some real work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I think I wrote very brusquely and disagreeably to
you the other day, but the impertinence was altogether
in the form and not at all in the feeling. I always
have uncomfortable sensations after writing objections
and criticisms when they relate to things I substantially
admire. It is inflicting a hurt on my own veneration.</p>

<p>I showed the passage on the eye, p. 157, to Herbert
Spencer, and he agrees with us that you have not
stated your idea so as to render it a logical argument
against design. You appear to imply that development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and gradation in organs and functions are opposed
to that conception, which they are not. I suppose
you are aware that we all three hold the conception
of creative design to be untenable. We only think
you have not made out a good case against it.</p>

<p>Thank you for sending me some news of Harriet
Martineau. I have often said lately, "I wonder how
she is."</p>

<p>I am glad you retain a doubt in favor of the <em>dagger</em>,
and wish I could convert you to entire approval, for I
am much more satisfied when your feeling is thoroughly
with me. But it would be the death of my
story to substitute a dream for the real scene. Dreams
usually play an important part in fiction, but rarely, I
think, in actual life.</p>

<p>So many of us have reason to know that criminal
impulses may be felt by a nature which is nevertheless
guarded by its entire constitution from the commission
of crime, that I can't help hoping that my
Caterina will not forfeit the sympathy of all my
readers.</p>

<p>The answer you propose to give to curious inquirers
is the best possible. For several reasons I am very
anxious to retain my <i>incognito</i> for some time to come,
and, to an author not already famous, anonymity is the
highest <i>prestige</i>. Besides, if George Eliot turns out a
dull dog and an ineffective writer&mdash;a mere flash in the
pan&mdash;I, for one, am determined to cut him on the first
intimation of that disagreeable fact.</p>

and we have the following recollections of their
stay there:</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Recollections,
Scilly
Isles,
March-May,
1857.</div>

<p>I had never before seen a granite coast, and on the
southern side of the island of St. Mary's one sees such
a coast in its most striking and characteristic forms.
Rectangular crevices, the edges of which have been
rounded by weather, give many of the granite masses
a resemblance to bales of wool or cotton heaped on
each other; another characteristic form is the mushroom-shaped
mass, often lying poised on the summits
of more cubical bowlders or fragments; another is the
immense flat platform stretching out like a pier into
the sea; another the oval basins formed by the action
of the rain-water on the summits of the rocks and bowlders.
The coloring of the rocks was very various and
beautiful; sometimes a delicate grayish-green, from
the shaggy byssus which clothes it, chiefly high up
from the water; then a light, warm brown; then black;
occasionally of a rich yellow; and here and there purplish.
Below the rocks, on the coast, are almost everywhere
heaps of white bowlders, sometimes remarkably
perfect ovals, and looking like huge eggs of some
monstrous bird. Hardly any weed was to be seen on
the granite, except here and there in a rock-pool, green
with young ulva; and no barnacles incrust the rock,
no black mussels, scarcely any limpets. The waves
that beat on this coast are clear as crystal, and we
used to delight in watching them rear themselves like
the horses of a mighty sea-god as they approached the
rocks on which they were broken into eddies of milky
foam. Along a great part of this southern coast there
stretch heathy or furzy downs, over which I used to
enjoy rambling immensely; there is a sense of freedom
in those unenclosed grounds that one never has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
in a railed park, however extensive. Then, on the
north side of the island, above Sandy Bar, what a view
we used to get of the opposite islands and reefs, with
their delicious violet and yellow tints&mdash;the tall ship or
two anchored in the Sound, changing their aspect like
living things, and when the wind was at all high the
white foam prancing round the reefs and rising in fountain-like
curves above the screen of rocks!</p>

<p>Many a wet and dirty walk we had along the lanes,
for the weather was often wet and almost always blustering.
Now and then, however, we had a clear sky
and a calm sea, and on such days it was delicious to
look up after the larks that were soaring above us, or
to look out on the island and reef studded sea. I never
enjoyed the lark before as I enjoyed it at Scilly&mdash;never
felt the full beauty of Shelley's poem on it before. A
spot we became very fond of towards the close of our
stay was Carne Lea, where, between two fine, jutting
piles of granite, there was a soft down, gay with the
pretty pink flowers of the thrift, which, in this island,
carpets the ground like greensward. Here we used to
sit and lie in the bright afternoons, watching the silver
sunlight on the waves&mdash;bright silver, not golden&mdash;it is
the morning and evening sunlight that is golden. A
week or two after our arrival we made the acquaintance
of Mr. Moyle, the surgeon, who became a delightful
friend to us, always ready to help with the contents of
his surgery or anything else at his command. We liked
to have him come and smoke a cigar in the evening,
and look in now and then for a little lesson in microscopy.
The little indications of the social life at Scilly
that we were able to pick up were very amusing. I
was repeatedly told, in order to make me aware who
Mr. Hall was, that he married a Miss Lemon. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
people at St. Mary's imagine that the lawyers and doctors
at Penzance are a sort of European characters
that every one knows. We heard a great deal about
Mr. Quill, an Irishman, the Controller of the Customs;
and one day, when we were making a call on one of
the residents, our host said two or three times, at intervals,
"I wish you knew Quill!" At last, on our
farewell call, we saw the distinguished Quill, with his
hair plastered down, his charming smile, and his trousers
with a broad stripe down each leg. Our host
amused us by his contempt for curs: "Oh, I wouldn't
have a cur&mdash;there's nothing to look at in a
cur!"<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Bray,
5th April,
1857.</div>

<p>The smallest details, written in the hastiest way,
that will enable me to imagine you as you are, are just
what I want; indeed, all I care about in correspondence.
We are more and more in love with these little
islands. There is not a tree to be seen, but there are
grand granite hills on the coast, such as I never saw
before, and furze-covered hills with larks soaring and
singing above them, and zoological wonders on the
shore to fill our bottles and our souls at once. For
some time I have been unusually weak and knock-up-able.
Our landlady is an excellent woman, but, like
almost all peculiarly domestic women, has not more
than rudimentary ideas of cooking; and in an island
where you can get nothing but beef, except by sending
to Penzance, that supreme science has its maximum
value. She seems to think eating a purely arbitrary
procedure&mdash;an abnormal function of mad people who
come to Scilly; and if we ask her what the people live
on here, is quite at a loss to tell us, apparently thinking
the question relates to the abstruser portion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
natural history. But I insist, and give her a culinary
lecture every morning, and we do, in the end, get fed.
Altogether our life here is so far better than the golden
age that we work as well as play. That is the happy
side of things. But there is a very sad one to me
which I shall not dwell upon&mdash;only tell you of. More
than a week ago I received the news that poor Chrissey
had lost one of her pretty little girls of fever; that
the other little one&mdash;they were the only two she had
at home with her&mdash;was also dangerously ill, and Chrissey
herself and her servant apparently attacked by typhus
too. The thought of her in this state is a perpetual
shadow to me in the sunshine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>I shudder at entering on such great subjects (as
"Design") in letters; my idle brain wants lashing to
work, like a negro, and will do nothing under a slighter
stimulus. We are enjoying a retrogression to old-fashioned
reading. I rush on the slightest pretext to Sophocles,
and am as excited about blind old &OElig;dipus as
any young lady can be about the latest hero with magnificent
eyes. But there is <em>one</em> new book we have been
enjoying, and so, I hope, have you&mdash;the "Life of Charlotte
Brontë." Deeply affecting throughout; in the
early part romantic, poetic, as one of her own novels;
in the later years tragic, especially to those who know
what sickness is. Mrs. Gaskell has done her work
admirably, both in the industry and care with which
she has gathered and selected her material, and in the
feeling with which she has presented it. There is one
exception, however, which I regret very much. She
sets down Branwell's conduct entirely to remorse.
Remorse may make sad work with a man, but it will
not make such a life as Branwell's was in the last three
or four years, unless the germs of vice had sprouted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and shot up long before, as it seems clear they had in
him. What a tragedy!&mdash;that picture of the old father
and the three sisters trembling, day and night, in terror
at the possible deeds of their drunken, brutal son
and brother! That is the part of the life which affects
me most.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Isaac P.

April, 1857.</div>

<p>I have been looking anxiously for some further tidings
of Chrissey since your last letter, which told me
that she and Kate were better, though not out of danger.
I try to hope that no news is good news; but if
you do not think it troublesome to write, I shall be
thankful to have that hope changed into certainty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to save multiplying letters&mdash;which I
know you are not fond of&mdash;I mention now what will
take no harm from being mentioned rather prematurely.
I should like Chrissey to have £15 of my
next half-year's income, due at the beginning of June,
to spend in taking a change of air as soon as she is
able to do so; and perhaps, if it were desirable for
her to leave before the money has been paid in, you
would be so kind as to advance it for a few weeks. I
am writing, of course, in ignorance of her actual state;
but I should think it must be good for her, as soon as
she is able to move, to leave that fever-infected place
for a time, and I know the money must have gone very
fast in recent expenses. I only suggest the change of
air as the thing that I should think best for Chrissey;
but, in any case, I should like her to have the money,
to do what she pleases with it. If she is well enough
please to give her the enclosed note, in which I have
suggested to her what I have just written to you.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to you for your last letter, and
shall be still more so if you will write me word of
Chrissey's present condition.

<p>Thank you for the pleasant notes of impressions
concerning my story, sent to me through Lewes.</p>

<p>I will pay attention to your caution about the danger
of huddling up my stories. Conclusions are the
weak point of most authors, but some of the fault lies
in the very nature of a conclusion, which is at best a
negation.</p>

<p>There must be something wrong in the winding-up
of "Amos," for I have heard of two persons who are
disappointed with the conclusion. But the story never
presented itself to me as possible to be protracted after
Milly's death. The drama ends there.</p>

<p>I am thinking of writing a short epilogue to "Mr.
Gilfil's Love-Story," and I will send it you with the
proof from Jersey, where, on a strict promise that I
am not to be dissected, I shall shortly join our friend
Lewes.</p>

<p>The third story will be very different from either of
the preceding, which will perhaps be an advantage, as
poor Tina's sad tale was necessarily rather monotonous
in its effects.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful moment (12th May) when we came
to our lodgings at Gorey. The orchards were all in
blossom&mdash;and this is an island of orchards. They
cover the slopes; they stretch before you in shady,
grassy, indefinite extent through every other gateway
by the roadside; they flourish in some spots almost
close to the sea. What a contrast to the Scilly Isles!
There you stand on the hills like a sparrow on the
housetop; here you are like the same sparrow when he
is hopping about on the branches with green above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
him, green below, and green all round. Gorey stands
in Granville Bay, where the grand old castle of Mont
Orgueil stands and keeps guard on a fine rocky promontory
overlooking the little harbor dotted with fishing
craft. There is a charming piece of common, or down,
where you can have the quietest, easiest walking, with
a carpet of minute wild-flowers that are not hindered
from flourishing by the sandy rain of the coast. I delighted
extremely in the brownish-green softness of
this undulating common, here and there varied with a
patch of bright green fern&mdash;all the prettier for two little
homesteads set down upon it, with their garden-fence
and sheltering trees. It was pretty in all lights,
but especially the evening light, to look round at the
castle and harbor, the village and the scattered dwellings
peeping out from among trees on the hill. The
castle is built of stone which has a beautiful pinkish-gray
tint, and the bright green ivy hangs oblique curtains
on its turreted walls, making it look like a natural
continuation or outgrowth of the rocky and grassy
height on which it stands. Then the eye wanders on
to the right and takes in the church standing half-way
down the hill, which is clothed with a plantation, and
shelters the little village, with its cloud of blue smoke;
still to the right, and the village breaks off, leaving
nothing but meadows in front of the slope that shuts
out the setting sun, and only lets you see a hint of the
golden glory that is reflected in the pink, eastern
clouds.</p>

<p>The first lovely walk we found inland was the Queen's
Fern Valley, where a broad strip of meadow and pasture
lies between two high slopes covered with woods
and ferny wilderness. When we first saw this valley
it was in the loveliest spring-time; the woods were a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
delicious mixture of red and tender green and purple.
We have watched it losing that spring beauty and passing
into the green and flowery luxuriance of June,
and now into the more monotonous summer tint of
July.</p>

<p>When the blossoms fell away from the orchards my
next delight was to look at the grasses mingled with the
red sorrel; then came the white umbelliferous plants,
making a border or inner frame for them along the
hedgerows and streams. Another pretty thing here is
the luxuriance of the yellow iris, that covers large pieces
of moist ground with its broad blades. Everywhere
there are tethered cows, looking at you with meek
faces&mdash;mild-eyed, sleek, fawn-colored creatures, with
delicate, downy udders.</p>

<p>Another favorite walk of ours was round by Mont
Orgueil, along the coast. Here we had the green or
rocky slope on one side of us, and on the other the
calm sea stretching to the coast of France, visible on
all but the murkiest days. But the murky days were
not many during our stay, and our evening walks round
the coast usually showed us a peaceful, scarcely rippled
sea, plashing gently on the purple pebbles of the little
scalloped bays. There were two such bays within the
boundary of our sea-side walk in that direction, and
one of them was a perpetual wonder to us, in the
luxuriant verdure of meadows and orchards and forest-trees
that sloped down to the very shore. No distressed
look about the trees as if they were ever driven
harshly back by the winter winds&mdash;it was like an inland
slope suddenly carried to the coast.</p>

<p>As for the inland walks, they are inexhaustible. The
island is one labyrinth of delicious roads and lanes,
leading you by the most charming nooks of houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
with shady grounds and shrubberies, delightful farm
homesteads, and trim villas.</p>

<p>It was a sweet, peaceful life we led here. Good
creatures, the Amys, our host and hostess, with their
nice boy and girl, and the little white kid&mdash;the family
pet. No disagreeable sounds to be heard in the house,
no unpleasant qualities to hinder one from feeling perfect
love to these simple people. We have had long
rambles and long readings. But our choice of literature
has been rather circumscribed in this out-of-the-way
place. The "Life of George Stephenson" has
been a real profit and pleasure. I have read Draper's
"Physiology" aloud for grave evening hours, and such
books as Currer Bell's "Professor," Mlle. d'Auny's
"Mariage en Province," and Miss Ferrier's "Marriage,"
for lighter food. The last, however, we found
ourselves unable to finish, notwithstanding Miss Ferrier's
high reputation. I have been getting a smattering
of botany from Miss Catlow and from Dr. Thomson's
little book on wild-flowers, which have created
at least a longing for something more complete on the
subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Such hedgerows in this island! Such orchards,
white against the green slopes, and shady walks by the
woodside, with distracting wild-flowers. We enjoy the
greenery and variety of this bushy island all the better
for our stay on bare Scilly, which we had gone to and
fro upon till we knew it by heart. Our little lodgings
are very snug&mdash;only 13<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;a nice little sitting-room,
with a workroom adjoining for Mr. Lewes, who
is at this moment in all the bliss of having discovered
a parasitic worm in a cuttlefish. We dine at five, and
our afternoons are almost exhausted in rambling. I
hope to get up my strength in this delicious quiet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
have fewer interruptions to work from headache than
I have been having since Christmas. I wonder if I
should have had the happiness of seeing Cara if I had
been at Richmond now. I would rather see her than
any one else in the world&mdash;except poor Chrissey.
Tell me when you have read the life of Currer Bell.
Some people think its revelations in bad taste&mdash;making
money out of the dead, wounding the feelings of
the living, etc. What book is there that some people
or other will not find abominable? We thought it admirable,
cried over it, and felt the better for it. We
read Cromwell's letters again at Scilly with great delight.</p>

<blockquote><p>In May Mr. Lewes writes to Mr. John Blackwood:
"We were both amused with the divination of
the Manx seer and his friend Liggers." This is
the first mention of the individual, whose real name
was Liggins of Nuneaton, who afterwards became
notorious for laying claim to the authorship of the
"Scenes of Clerical Life" and "Adam Bede."</p>

<p>"Janet's Repentance" had been begun on the

He writes very pleasantly, says the series is
attributed by many to Bulwer, and that Thackeray
thinks highly of it. This was a pleasant fillip to me,
who am just now ready to be dispirited on the slightest
pretext.</p>

<p><i>May 21.</i>&mdash;The other day we had a pleasant letter

<p>"Sir,&mdash;Will you consider it impertinent in a
brother author and old reviewer to address a few
lines of earnest sympathy and admiration to you,
excited by the purity of your style, originality of
your thoughts, and absence of all vulgar seeking
for effect in those 'Scenes of Clerical Life' now
appearing in <cite>Blackwood</cite>? If I mistake not much,
your muse of invention is no hackneyed one, and
your style is too peculiar to allow of your being
confounded with any of the already well-known
writers of the day. Your great and characteristic
charm is, to my mind, Nature. You frequently, indeed,
express what I may call brilliant ideas, but
they always seem to come unsought for, never, as
in Lytton, for instance, to be elaborated and placed
in the most advantageous light. I allude to such
brief aphoristic sayings as 'Animals are such agreeable
friends, they ask no questions, they pass no
criticisms'&mdash;'All with that brisk and cheerful air
which a sermon is often observed to produce when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
it is quite finished.' By-the-bye. I am one of the
cloth, and might take exception to certain hints,
perhaps, but these are dubious. What I see plainly
I admire honestly, and trust that more good remains
behind. Will you always remain equally
natural? That is the doubt. Will the fear of the
critic, or the public, or the literary world, which
spoils almost every one, never master you? Will
you always write to please yourself, and preserve the
true independence which seems to mark a real supremacy
of intellect? But these questions are, I
fear, impertinent. I will conclude. Pardon this
word of greeting from one whom you may never
see or know, and believe me your earnest admirer,</p>

<p><i>June.</i>&mdash;Blackwood writes from London that he hears
nothing but approval of "Mr. Gilfil's Love-Story."
Lord Stanley, among other people, had spoken to him
about the "Clerical Scenes," at Bulwer's, and was astonished
to find Blackwood in the dark as to the author.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>I send you by the same post with this the first part
of my third story, which I hope will not disappoint
you. The part is, I think, rather longer than my parts
have usually been, but it would have been injurious to
the effect of the story to pause earlier.</p>

<p>Pleasant letters like yours are the best possible
stimulus to an author's powers, and if I don't write
better and better the fault will certainly not lie in my
editor, who seems to have been created in pre-established
harmony with the organization of a susceptible
contributor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>This island, too, with its grassy valleys and pretty,
indented coast is not at all a bad haunt for the Muses,
if, as one may suppose, they have dropped their too
scanty classical attire, and appear in long dresses and
brown hats, like decent Christian women likely to inspire
"Clerical Scenes."</p>

<p>Moreover, having myself a slight zoological weakness,
I am less alarmed than most people at the society
of a zoological maniac. So that, altogether, your contributor
is in promising circumstances, and if he doesn't
behave like an animal in good condition, is clearly unworthy
of his keep.</p>

<p>I am much gratified to have made the conquest of
Professor Aytoun; but with a parent's love for the depreciated
child, I can't help standing up for "Amos"
as better than "Gilfil."</p>

<p>Lewes seems to have higher expectations from the
third story than from either of the preceding; but I
can form no judgment myself until I have quite finished
a thing, and see it aloof from my actual self. I can
only go on writing what I feel, and waiting for the
proof that I have been able to make others feel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. Bray,

<p>Richmond is <em>not</em> fascinating in "the season" or
through the summer. It is hot, noisy, and haunted
with Cockneys; but at other times we love the Park
with an increasing love, and we have such a kind, good
landlady there, that it always seems like going home
when we return to Park Shot. She writes to us: "I
hope you will make your fortune&mdash;but you must always
live with me," which, considering that she gets
less out of us than other lodgers, is a proof of affection
in a landlady. Yes! we like our wandering life at
present, and it is fructifying, and brings us material in
many ways; but we keep in perspective the idea of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
cottage among green fields and cows, where we mean
to settle down (after we have once been to Italy), and
buy pots and kettles and keep a dog. Wherever we
are we work hard&mdash;and at work which brings <em>present</em>
money; for we have too many depending on us to be
<i>dilettanti</i> or idlers.</p>

<p>I wish it to be understood that I should never invite
any one to come and see me who did not ask for the
invitation.</p>

<p>You wonder how my face has changed in the last
three years. Doubtless it is older and uglier, but it
ought not to have a bad expression, for I never have
anything to call out my ill-humor or discontent, which
you know were always ready enough to come on slight
call, and I have everything to call out love and gratitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
Mrs. John
Cash (Miss
Mary Sibree),
6th
June, 1857.</div>

<p>Your letter was very sweet to me. The sense of
my deficiencies in the past often presses on me with a
discouraging weight, and to know that any one can remember
me lovingly, helps me to believe that there
has been some good to balance the evil. I like to
think of you as a happy wife and mother; and since
Rosehill must have new tenants, I like to think that
you and yours are there rather than any one else, not
only because of my own confidence in your nature, but
because our dear friends love you so much as a neighbor.
You know I can never feel otherwise than sorry
that they should not have ended their days in that
pretty home; but the inevitable regret is softened as
much as possible by the fact that the home has become
yours.</p>

<p>It is very nice to hear that Mrs. Sibree can relish
anything of my writing. She was always a favorite
with me; and I remember very vividly many pleasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
little conversations with her. Seventy-two! How
happy you are to have a dear, aged mother, whose
heart you can gladden.</p>

<p>I was a good deal touched by the letter your brother
wrote to you about accepting, or, rather, declining, more
pupils. I feel sure that his sensitive nature has its
peculiar trials and struggles in this strange life of ours,
which some thick-skinned mortals take so easily.</p>

<p>I am very happy&mdash;happy in the highest blessing life
can give us, the perfect love and sympathy of a nature
that stimulates my own to healthful activity. I feel,
too, that all the terrible pain I have gone through in
past years, partly from the defects of my own nature,
partly from outward things, has probably been a preparation
for some special work that I may do before I
die. That is a blessed hope, to be rejoiced in with
trembling. But even if that hope should be unfulfilled,
I am contented to have lived and suffered for the sake
of what has already been. You see your kind letter
has made me inclined to talk about myself, but, as we
do not often have any communication with each other,
I know it will be a gratification to your sympathetic
nature to have a few direct words from me that will
assure you of my moral well-being.</p>

<p>I hope your little ones are just like you&mdash;just as fair
and sweet-tempered.</p>

<p>I sent off the first part of "Janet's Repentance," but
to my disappointment Blackwood did not like it so
well&mdash;seemed to misunderstand the characters, and to
be doubtful about the treatment of clerical matters.
I wrote at once to beg him to give up printing the
story if he felt uncomfortable about it, and he immediately
sent a very anxious, cordial letter, saying the
thought of putting a stop to the series "gave him quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
a turn:" he "did not meet with George Eliots every
day"&mdash;and so on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
to John
Blackwood,
11th
June, 1857.</div>

<p>I am not much surprised and not at all hurt by your
letter received to-day with the proof. It is a great
satisfaction&mdash;in fact, my only satisfaction&mdash;that you
should give me your judgment with perfect frankness.
I am able, I think, to enter into an editor's doubts and
difficulties, and to see my stories in some degree from
your point of view as well as my own. My answer is
written after considering the question as far as possible
on all sides, and as I feel that I shall not be able
to make any other than <em>superficial</em> alterations in the
proof, I will, first of all, say what I can in explanation
of the spirit and future course of the present story.</p>

<p>The collision in the drama is not at all between
"bigoted churchmanship" and evangelicalism, but between
<em>ir</em>religion and religion. Religion in this case
happens to be represented by evangelicalism; and the
story, so far as regards the <em>persecution</em>, is a real bit in
the religious history of England, that happened about
eight-and-twenty years ago. I thought I had made it
apparent in my sketch of Milby feelings, on the advent
of Mr. Tryan, that the conflict lay between immorality
and morality&mdash;irreligion and religion. Mr. Tryan will
carry the reader's sympathy. It is through him that
Janet is brought to repentance. Dempster's vices have
their natural evolution in deeper and deeper moral deterioration
(though not without softening touches), and
death from intemperance. Everything is softened from
the fact, so far as art is permitted to soften and yet to
remain essentially true.</p>

<p>My sketches, both of Churchmen and Dissenters,
with whom I am almost equally acquainted, are drawn
from close observation of them in real life, and not at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
all from hearsay or from the descriptions of novelists.
If I were to undertake to alter language or character.
I should be attempting to represent some vague conception
of what may possibly exist in other people's
minds, but has no existence in my own. Such of your
marginal objections as relate to a mere detail I can
meet without difficulty by alteration; but as an artist
I should be utterly powerless if I departed from my
own conceptions of life and character. There is nothing
to be done with the story, but either to let Dempster
and Janet and the rest be as I <em>see</em> them, or to renounce
it as too painful. I am keenly alive at once
to the scruples and alarms an editor may feel, and to
my own utter inability to write under cramping influence,
and on this double ground I should like you to
consider whether it will not be better to close the
series for the Magazine <em>now</em>. I dare say you will feel
no difficulty about publishing a volume containing the
story of "Janet's Repentance," and I shall accept that
plan with no other feeling than that you have been
to me the most liberal and agreeable of editors, and
are the man of all others I would choose for a publisher.</p>

<p>My irony, so far as I understand myself, is not directed
against opinions&mdash;against any class of religious
views&mdash;but against the vices and weaknesses that belong
to human nature in every sort of clothing. But
it is possible that I may not affect other minds as I
intend and wish to affect them, and you are a better
judge than I can be of the degree in which I may occasionally
be offensive. I should like <em>not</em> to be offensive&mdash;I
should like to touch every heart among my
readers with nothing but loving humor, with tenderness,
with belief in goodness. But I may have failed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
in this case of "Janet," at least so far as to have made
you feel its publication in the Magazine a disagreeable
risk. If so, there will be no harm done by closing the
series with No. 2, as I have suggested. If, however, I
take your objections to be deeper than they really are&mdash;if
you prefer inserting the story in spite of your partial
dissatisfaction, I shall, of course, be happy to appear
under "Maga's" wing still.</p>

<p>When I remember what have been the successes in
fiction, even as republications from "Maga," I can hardly
believe that the public will regard my pictures as exceptionally
coarse. But in any case there are too
many prolific writers who devote themselves to the
production of pleasing pictures, to the exclusion of all
disagreeable truths, for me to desire to add to their
number. In this respect, at least, I may have some
resemblance to Thackeray, though I am not conscious
of being in any way a disciple of his, unless it constitute
discipleship to think him, as I suppose the majority
of people with any intellect do, on the whole the most
powerful of living novelists.</p>

<p>Lewes has just given me your letter of the 15th, with
the accompanying one from the Rev. W. P. Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. Tryan is not a portrait of any clergyman, living
or dead. He is an ideal character, but I hope probable
enough to resemble more than one evangelical
clergyman of his day.</p>

<p>If Mr. Jones's deceased brother was like Mr. Tryan
so much the better, for in that case he was made of
human nature's finer clay. I think you will agree with
me that there are few clergymen who would be depreciated
by an identification with Mr. Tryan. But I
should rather suppose that the old gentleman, misled
by some similarity in outward circumstances, is blind
to the discrepancies which must exist where no portrait
was intended. As to the rest of my story, so far
as its elements were suggested by real persons, those
persons have been, to use good Mr. Jones's phrase,
"long in eternity."</p>

<p>I think I told you that a persecution of the kind I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
have described did actually take place, and belongs as
much to the common store of our religious history as
the Gorham Controversy, or as Bishop Blomfield's decision
about wax candles. But I only know the <em>outline</em>
of the real persecution. The details have been filled
in from my imagination. I should consider it a fault
which would cause me lasting regret if I had used reality
in any other than the legitimate way common to
all artists, who draw their materials from their observation
and experience. It would be a melancholy result
of my fictions if I gave <em>just</em> cause of annoyance to any
good and sensible person. But I suppose there is no
perfect safeguard against erroneous impressions or a
mistaken susceptibility. We are all apt to forget how
little there is about us that is unique, and how very
strongly we resemble many other insignificant people
who have lived before us. I shouldn't wonder if several
nieces of pedantic maiden ladies saw a portrait of
their aunt in Miss Pratt, but I hope they will not think
it necessary, on that ground, to increase the already
troublesome number of your correspondents.</p>

set about it without delay. It will be a country story&mdash;full
of the breath of cows and the scent of hay. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
I shall not ask you to look at it till I have written a
volume or more, and then you will be able to judge
whether you will prefer printing it in the Magazine, or
publishing it as a separate novel when it is completed.</p>

<p>By the way, the sheets of the "Clerical Scenes" are
not come, but I shall not want to make any other than
verbal and literal corrections, so that it will hardly be
necessary for me to go through the sheets <em>and</em> the
proofs, which I must, of course, see.</p>

<p>I enclose a titlepage with a motto. But if you
don't like the motto, I give it up. I've not set my
heart on it.</p>

<p>I leave the number of copies to be published, and
the style of getting up, entirely to your discretion. As
to the terms, I wish to retain the copyright, according
to the stipulation made for me by Lewes when he sent
"Amos Barton;" and whatever you can afford to give
me for the first edition I shall prefer having as a definite
payment rather than as half profits.</p>

<p>You stated, in a letter about "Amos Barton," your
willingness to accede to either plan, so I have no hesitation
in expressing my wishes.</p>

<p>"Open to conviction," indeed! I should think so.
I am open to conviction on all points except dinner

means, and listens to what others say. We should
quite like to see him often. And I cannot tell you how
much I have felt Mrs. Call's graceful as well as kind
behavior to me. Some months ago, before the new
edition of the "Biographical History of Philosophy"
came out, Mr. Lewes had a letter from a working-man
at Leicester, I think, who said that he and some fellow-students
met together, on a Sunday, to read the book
aloud and discuss it. He had marked some errors of
the press and sent them to Mr. Lewes for his new edition.
Wasn't that pretty?</p>

<p>"Conscience goes to the hammering in of nails" is
my gospel. There can be no harm in preaching <em>that</em>
to women at any rate. But I should be sorry to undertake
any more specific enunciation of doctrine on a
question so entangled as the "woman question." The
part of the Epicurean gods is always an easy one; but
because I prefer it so strongly myself, I the more highly
venerate those who are struggling in the thick of
the contest. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La carrière ouverte aux taléns</span>," whether
the talents be feminine or masculine, I am quite confident
is a right maxim. Whether "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La carrière ouverte
à la Sottise</span>" be equally just when made equally
universal, it would be too much like "taking sides"
for me to say.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 9.</i>&mdash;Finished "Janet's Repentance." I had meant
to carry on the series, and especially I longed to tell
the story of the "Clerical Tutor," but my annoyance
at Blackwood's want of sympathy in the first part (although
he came round to admiration at the third part)
determined me to close the series and republish them
in two volumes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>I am quite contented with the sum (£120) you offer
me for the edition, being thoroughly confident of your
disposition to do the best you can for me. I perceive
your hope of success for the "Scenes" is not strong,
and you certainly have excellent means of knowing the
probabilities in such a case.</p>

<p>I am not aware that the motto has been used before,

<p>How I wish I could get to you by some magic, and
have one walk over the hill with you again. Letters
are poor things compared with five minutes of looking
and speaking, and one kiss. Nevertheless, I do like
to have a little letter now and then, though I don't for a
moment ask it if you have no spontaneous impulse to
give it. I can't help losing belief that people love me&mdash;the
unbelief is in my nature, and no sort of fork will
drive it finally out. I can't help wondering that you
can think of <em>me</em> in the past with much pleasure. It all
seems so painful to me&mdash;made up of blunders and
selfishness&mdash;and it only comes back upon me as a thing
to be forgiven. That is honest, painful truth, and not
sentimentality. But I am thankful if others found
more good than I am able to remember.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to have the first sheet of one's proof&mdash;to
see one's paragraphs released from the tight-lacing
of double columns, and expanding themselves at their
ease.</p>

<p>I perceive clearly the desirableness of the short number&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
my observation of literary affairs has gone far
enough to convince me that neither critical judgment
nor practical experience can guarantee any opinion as
to rapidity of sale in the case of an unknown author;
and I shudder at the prospect of encumbering my publisher's
bookshelves.</p>

<p>My new story is in progress&mdash;slow progress at present.
A little sunshine of success would stimulate its
growth, I dare say. Unhappily, I am as impressionable
as I am obstinate, and as much in need of sympathy
from my readers as I am incapable of bending
myself to their tastes. But if I can only find a public
as cordial and agreeable in its treatment of me as my
editor, I shall have nothing to wish. Even my thin
skin will be comfortable then. The page is not a
shabby one, after all; but I fear the fact of two volumes
instead of three is a fatal feature in my style in
the eyes of librarians.</p>

<p>One is glad to have one's book (<i>à propos</i> of review
of Lewes's "History of Philosophy") spoken well of
by papers of good circulation, because it is possible,
though not certain, that such praise may help the sale;
but otherwise it is hardly worth while to trouble one's
self about newspaper reviews, unless they point out
some error, or present that very rare phenomenon, a
true appreciation, which is the most delicious form in
which sympathy can reach one. So much sectarian
feeling usually arises in discussions on the subject of
phrenology that I confess the associations of the word
are not agreeable to me. The last refuge of intolerance
is in not tolerating the intolerant; and I am often
in danger of secreting that sort of venom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>It is pleasant to have a kind word now and then,
when one is not near enough to have a kind glance or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
a hearty shake by the hand. It is an old weakness of
mine to have no faith in affection that does not express
itself; and when friends take no notice of me for a
long while I generally settle down into the belief that
they have become indifferent or have begun to dislike
me. That is not the best mental constitution; but it
might be worse&mdash;for I don't feel obliged to dislike
<em>them</em> in consequence. I, for one, ought not to complain
if people think worse of me than I deserve, for I
have very often reason to be ashamed of my thoughts
about others. They almost always turn out to be better
than I expected&mdash;fuller of kindness towards me at
least. In the fundamental doctrine of your book (the
philosophy of necessity)&mdash;that mind presents itself under
the same conditions of invariableness of antecedent
and consequent as all other phenomena (the only difference
being that the true antecedent and consequent
are proportionately difficult to discover as the phenomena
are more complex)&mdash;I think you know that I
agree. And every one who knows what science means
must also agree with you that there can be no social
science without the admission of that doctrine. I dislike
extremely a passage in which you appear to consider
the disregard of individuals as a lofty condition
of mind. My own experience and development deepen
every day my conviction that our moral progress
may be measured by the degree in which we sympathize
with individual suffering and individual joy. The fact
that in the scheme of things we see a constant and
tremendous sacrifice of individuals, is, it seems to me,
only one of the many proofs that urge upon us our total
inability to find in our own natures a key to the Divine
mystery. I could more readily turn Christian, and
worship Jesus again, than embrace a Theism which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
professes to explain the proceedings of God. But I
don't feel at all wise in these matters. I have a few
strong impressions which serve me for my own support
and guidance, but do not in the least qualify me to
speak as a theorist.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes sends you his kind remembrances, and
will not like you any the worse for cutting him up.
He has had to perform that office for his own friends
sometimes. I suppose phrenology is an open question,
on which everybody has a right to speak his mind.
Mr. Lewes, feeling the importance of the subject, desired
to give it its due place in his "History of Philosophy,"
and, doing so, he must, of course, say what <em>he</em> believes
to be the truth, not what other people believe to be the
truth. If you will show where he is mistaken, you
will be doing him a service as well as phrenology.
His arguments may be bad; but I will answer for
him that he has not been guilty of any intentional unfairness.
With regard to their system, phrenologists
seem to me to be animated by the same sort of spirit
as that of religious dogmatists, and especially in this&mdash;that
in proportion as a man approximates to their opinions
without identifying himself with them, they think
him offensive and contemptible. It is amusing to read
from the opposite side complaints against Mr. Lewes
for giving too high a position to phrenology, and a confident
opinion that "phrenologists, by their ridiculous
pretensions, merit all the contempt that has been
thrown on them." Thus doctors differ! But I am
much less interested in crusades for or against phrenology
than in your happiness at Ivy
Cottage.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Happiness
means all sorts of love and good feeling; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
that is the best result that can ever come out of
science. Do you know Buckle's "History of Civilization"?
I think you would find it a suggestive book.</p>

<p>Anniversaries are sad things&mdash;to one who has lived
long and done little. Herbert Spencer dined with us
the other day&mdash;looks well, and is brimful of clever
talk as usual. His volume of "Essays" is to come
out soon. He is just now on a crusade against the
notion of "species." We are reading Harriet Martineau's
history with edification, and otherwise feeding
our souls, which flourish very well, notwithstanding
November weather.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,

<p><i>Nov. 28.</i>&mdash;A glorious day, still autumnal and not
wintry. We have had a delicious walk in the Park,
and I think the coloring of the scenery is more beautiful
than ever. Many of the oaks are still thickly covered
with leaves of a rich yellow-brown; the elms,
golden sometimes, still with lingering patches of green.
On our way to the Park the view from Richmond hill
had a delicate blue mist over it, that seemed to hang
like a veil before the sober brownish-yellow of the distant
elms. As we came home, the sun was setting
on a fog-bank, and we saw him sink into that purple
ocean&mdash;the orange and gold passing into green above
the fog-bank, the gold and orange reflected in the river
in more sombre tints. The other day, as we were coming
home through the Park, after having walked under a
sombre, heavily clouded sky, the western sun shone
out from under the curtain, and lit up the trees and
grass, thrown into relief on a background of dark purple
cloud. Then, as we advanced towards the Richmond
end of the Park, the level, reddening rays shone
on the dry fern and the distant oaks, and threw a crimson
light on them. I have especially enjoyed this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
autumn, the delicious greenness of the turf, in contrast
with the red and yellow of the dying leaves.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 6</i> (<i>Sunday</i>).&mdash;Finished the "Agamemnon" to-day.
In the evenings of late we have been reading
Harriet Martineau's "Sketch of the British Empire in
India," and are now following it up with Macaulay's
articles on Clive and Hastings. We have lately read
Harriet Martineau's Introduction to the "History of
the Peace."</p>

<p><i>Dec. 8.</i>&mdash;I am reading "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Familie</span>," by Riehl,
forming the third volume of the series, the two first of
which, "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Land und Volk</span>" and "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Bürgerliche Gesellschaft</span>,"
I reviewed for the <cite>Westminster</cite>.</p>

<p>A letter from Blackwood to-day tells us that Major
Blackwood, during his brother's absence in England,
having some reasons, not specified, for being more
hopeful about the "Clerical Scenes," resolved to publish
1000 instead of 750; and in consequence of this
Blackwood promises to pay me an additional £60
when 750 shall have been sold off. He reports that
an elderly clergyman has written to him to say that
"Janet's Repentance" is exquisite&mdash;another vote to
register along with that of Mrs. Nutt's rector, who
"cried over the story like a child."</p>

<p><i>Dec. 10.</i>&mdash;Major Blackwood called&mdash;an unaffected,
agreeable man. It was evident to us, when he had
only been in the room a few minutes, that he knew I
was George Eliot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter

<p>Lewes has read to me your last kind letter, and I am
not insensible to the "practical cheerer" it contains.
But I rejoice with trembling at the additional 250, lest
you should have to repent of them.</p>

<p>I have certainly had a good deal of encouragement
to believe that there are many minds, both of the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
cultured sort and of the common novel-reading class,
likely to be touched by my stories; but the word
"many" is very elastic, and often shrinks frightfully
when measured by a financial standard.</p>

<p>When one remembers how long it was before Charles
Lamb's Essays were known familiarly to any but the
elect few, the very strongest assurance of merit or
originality&mdash;supposing one so happy as to have that
assurance&mdash;could hardly do more than give the hope
of <em>ultimate</em> recognition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Our affairs are very prosperous just now, making
sunshine in a shady, or, rather, in a foggy place. It is
a great happiness to me that Mr. Lewes gets more and
more of the recognition he deserves; pleasant letters
and speeches have been very numerous lately, especially
about his "Sea-side Studies," which have appeared
in <cite>Blackwood</cite>, and are soon to appear&mdash;very
much improved and enlarged&mdash;in a separate volume.
Dear Carlyle writes, <i>à propos</i> of his "Friedrich:" "I
have had such a fourteen months as was never appointed
me before in this world&mdash;sorrow, darkness,
and disgust my daily companions; and no outlook visible,
except getting a detestable business turned off, or
else being driven mad by it." That is his exaggerated
way of speaking; and writing is always painful to him.
Do you know he is sixty-two! I fear this will be his
last book. Tell Mr. Bray I am reading a book of
Riehl's, "The Family," forming the sequel to his other
volumes. He will be pleased to hear that so good a
writer agrees with him on several points about the occupations
of women. The book is a good one; and if
I were in the way of writing articles, I should write one
on it. There is so much to read, and the days are so
short! I get more hungry for knowledge every day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
and less able to satisfy my hunger. Time is like the
Sibylline leaves, getting more precious the less there
remains of it. That, I believe, is the correct allusion
for a fine writer to make on the occasion.</p>

<p>I give up the motto, because it struck you as having

<p><i>Dec. 17.</i>&mdash;Read my new story to G. this evening as
far as the end of the third chapter. He praised it
highly. I have finished "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Familie</span>," by Riehl&mdash;a
delightful book. I am in the "Choephoræ" now. In
the evenings we are reading "History of the Thirty
Years' Peace" and Béranger. Thoroughly disappointed
in Béranger.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 19</i> (<i>Saturday</i>).&mdash;Alone this evening with very
thankful, solemn thoughts&mdash;feeling the great and unhoped-for
blessings that have been given me in life.
This last year, especially, has been marked by inward
progress and outward advantages. In the spring
George's "History of Philosophy" appeared in the
new edition; his "Sea-side Studies" have been written
with much enjoyment, and met with much admiration,
and now they are on the verge of being published
with bright prospects. Blackwood has also accepted
his "Physiology of Common Life;" the "Goethe" has
passed into its third German edition; and, best of all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
G.'s head is well. I have written the "Scenes of Clerical
Life"&mdash;my first book; and though we are uncertain
still whether it will be a success as a separate publication,
I have had much sympathy from my readers in
<cite>Blackwood</cite>, and feel a deep satisfaction in having done
a bit of faithful work that will perhaps remain, like a
primrose root in the hedgerow, and gladden and chasten
human hearts in years to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Buckle's is a book full of suggestive material, though
there are some strangely unphilosophic opinions mixed
with its hardy philosophy. For example, he holds that
there is no such thing as <i>race</i> or <i>hereditary transmission</i>
of qualities! (I should tell you, at the same time, that
he is a necessitarian and a physiological-psychologist.)
It is only by such negations as these that he can find
his way to the position which he maintains at great
length&mdash;that the progress of mankind is dependent entirely
on the progress of knowledge, and that there has
been no intrinsically moral advance. However, he
presents that side of the subject which has, perhaps,
been least adequately dwelt on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal,

<p><i>Dec. 25</i> (<i>Christmas Day</i>).&mdash;George and I spent this
lovely day together&mdash;lovely as a clear spring day. We
could see Hampstead from the Park so distinctly that
it seemed to have suddenly come nearer to us. We
ate our turkey together in a happy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">solitude à deux</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 31</i> (<i>the last night of 1857</i>).&mdash;The dear old year
is gone with all its <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weben</i> and <i>Streben</i>. Yet not gone
either; for what I have suffered and enjoyed in it remains
to me an everlasting possession while my soul's
life remains. This time last year I was alone, as I am
now, and dear George was at Vernon Hill. I was
writing the introduction to "Mr. Gilfil's Love-Story."
What a world of thoughts and feelings since then! My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
life has deepened unspeakably during the last year: I
feel a greater capacity for moral and intellectual enjoyment,
a more acute sense of my deficiencies in
the past, a more solemn desire to be faithful to coming
duties, than I remember at any former period of my
life. And my happiness has deepened too; the blessedness
of a perfect love and union grows daily. I have
had some severe suffering this year from anxiety about
my sister, and what will probably be a final separation
from her&mdash;there has been no other real trouble. Few
women, I fear, have had such reason as I have to
think the long, sad years of youth were worth living for
the sake of middle age. Our prospects are very bright
too. I am writing my new novel. G. is full of his
"Physiology of Common Life." He has just finished
editing Johnston, for which he is to have 100 guineas,
and we have both encouragement to think that our
books just coming out, "Sea-side Studies" and "Scenes
of Clerical Life," will be well received. So good-bye,
dear 1857! May I be able to look back on 1858 with
an equal consciousness of advancement in work and in
heart.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p>As this volume is going through the press, I have to
thank Mrs. John Cash of Coventry for the following
valuable additional information in regard to the important
subject of Miss Evans's change of religious belief
in 1841-42, and for her further general recollections
of the Coventry period of George Eliot's life:</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I was sixteen years of age in 1841; and, as I have
already stated, my first remembrance of Miss Evans is
of her call on my father and mother, with their friend
and neighbor Mrs. Pears, when in conversation she
gave expression to her great appreciation of the writings
of Isaac Taylor. The controversy raised by the
"Tracts for the Times," which gave occasion for the
publication of Mr. Taylor's "Ancient Christianity,"
being now remote, I give the following extract from a
footnote in Trench's "Notes on the Parables," to show
the influence such a work as Mr. Taylor's would be
likely to exercise on the mind of one who esteemed its
author; and also the feeling it excited against an eminently
religious man, by revelations which he desired
and believed would serve the cause of New Testament
Christianity. The note is on the "Tares." The
quotation, containing the reference, is from Menken:</p>

<p>"Many so-called Church historians (<i>authors of 'Ancient
Christianity' and the like</i>), ignorant of the purpose
and of the hidden glory of the Church, have their pleasure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
in the Tares, and imagine themselves wonderfully
wise and useful when out of Church history (which
ought to be the history of the Light and the Truth)
they have made a shameful history of error and wickedness."</p>

<p>It was upon her first or second interview with my
mother that Miss Evans told her how shocked she had
been by the apparent union of religious feeling with a
low sense of morality among the people in the district
she visited, who were mostly Methodists. She gave as
an instance the case of a woman who, when a falsehood
was clearly brought home to her by her visitors, said,
"She did not feel that she had grieved the Spirit much."
Now those readers of the letters to Miss Lewis who
are acquainted with modern Evangelicalism, even in
its "after-glow," especially as it was presented to the
world by Church of England teaching and practice,
will recognize its characteristics in the moral scrupulousness,
the sense of obligation on the part of Christians
to avoid the very appearance of evil, the practical piety,
which those letters reveal.</p>

<p>Mrs. Evans (Miss Lewis tells me) was a very serious,
earnest-minded woman, anxiously concerned for the
moral and religious training of her children: glad to
place them under the care of such persons as the
Misses Franklin, to whose school a mother of a different
order objected, on the ground that "it was where
that saint Mary Ann Evans had been."</p>

<p>It is natural then that, early awed by and attracted
towards beliefs cherished by the best persons she had
known, and advocated in the best books she had read,
the mind of Miss Evans should have been stirred by
exhibitions of a <em>theoretic</em> severance of religion from morality,
whether presented among the disciples of "Ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Christianity" or by the subjects of its modern
revivals: it is probable that she may thereby have been
led, as others have been, to a reconsideration of the
creeds of Christendom, and to further inquiry concerning
their origin.</p>

<p>On the same grounds it is likely that the presentation
of social virtues, apart from evangelical motives,
would impress her; and I have authority for stating
that to the inquiry of a friend in after-years, as to what
influence she attributed the first unsettlement of her
orthodox views, she quickly made answer: "Oh, Walter
Scott's." Now I well remember her speaking to
me of Robert Hall's confession that he had been
made unhappy for a week by the reading of Miss
Edgeworth's Tales, in which useful, good, and pleasant
lives are lived with no reference to religious hopes
and fears; and her drawing my attention to the real
greatness of mind and sincerity of faith which this
candid confession betokened. Such remarks, I think,
throw light upon the <em>way</em> in which her own evangelical
belief had been affected by works in which its
dogmas are not enforced as necessary springs of virtuous
action.</p>

<p>I give these scattered reminiscences, in evidence of
the half-unconscious preparation (of which Mr. Cross
speaks) for a change which was, in my judgment,
more gradual in its development, as well as deeper in
its character, than might be inferred from the record
of its abrupt following upon Miss Evans's introduction
to Mr. Hennell's "Inquiry concerning the Origin of
Christianity."</p>

<p>The evening's discussion with my father, to which I
have referred in my previous communication in the
"Life," is now vividly present to my mind. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
not only on her part a vehemence of tone, startling in
one so quiet, but a crudeness in her objections, an absence
of proposed solution of difficulties, which partly
distressed and partly pleased me (siding as I did
mentally with my father), and which was in strange
contrast to the satisfied calm which marked her subsequent
treatment of religious differences.</p>

<p>Upon my father's using an argument (common
enough in those days) drawn from the present condition
of the Jews as a fulfilment of prophecy, and saying,
"If I were tempted to doubt the truth of the
Bible, I should only have to look at a Jew to confirm
my faith in it." "Don't talk to me of the Jews!"
Miss Evans retorted, in an irritated tone; "to think
that they were deluded into expectations of a temporal
deliverer, and then punished because they
couldn't understand that it was a spiritual deliverer
that was intended!" To something that followed
from her, intimating the claim of creatures upon their
Creator, my father objected, "But we have no claim
upon God." "No claim upon God!" she reiterated
indignantly; "we have the strongest possible claim
upon him."</p>

<p>I regret that I can recall nothing more of a conversation
carried on for more than two hours; but I
vividly remember how deeply Miss Evans was moved,
and how, as she stood against the mantelpiece during
the last part of the time, her delicate fingers, in which
she held a small piece of muslin on which she was at
work, trembled with her agitation.</p>

<p>The impression allowed to remain upon the minds
of her friends, for some time after she had made
declaration of her heresies, was of her being in a
troubled, unsettled state. So great were her simplicity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
and candor in acknowledging this, and so apparent
was her earnest desire for truth, that no hesitation was
felt in asking her to receive visits from persons of different
persuasions, who were judged competent to
bring forward the best arguments in favor of orthodox
doctrines. One of these was a Baptist minister, introduced
to her by Miss Franklin; he was said to be
well read in divinity, and I remember him as an original
and interesting preacher. After an interview
with Miss Evans, meeting my father, he said: "That
young lady must have had the devil at her elbow to
suggest her doubts, for there was not a book that I
recommended to her in support of Christian evidences
that she had not read."</p>

<p>Mr. Watts, one of the professors at Spring Hill College
(Independent), Birmingham, a colleague of Mr.
Henry Rogers, author of the "Eclipse of Faith," and
who had himself studied at the Hallé University, and
enjoyed the friendship of Dr. Tholück, was requested
(I think by my mother) to call on Miss Evans. His
acquaintance with German Rationalism (rare in England
in those days) qualified him to enter into, and it
was hoped to meet, difficulties raised by a critical
study of the New Testament. After his first or second
interview, my brother remembers his observing with
emphasis, "<em>She</em> has gone into the question;" and I
can recall a reference made by him at a later date in
my hearing to Miss Evans's discontent with her own
solutions&mdash;or rather with her own standpoint at that
time. This discontent, he said, "was so far satisfactory."
Doubtless it gave him hope of the reconversion
of one who had, as he told my mother, awakened
deep interest in his own mind, as much by the earnestness
which characterized her inquiries as by her exceptional
attainments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>From letters that passed between my brother and
myself during his residence in Germany, I give the
following extracts referring to this period.</p>

<p>The first is from one of mine, dated September 2,
1842:</p>

<p>"In my father's absence we (my mother and I)
called on Miss Evans. She now takes up a different
position. Her views are not altogether altered, but
she says it would be extreme arrogance in so young a
person to suppose she had obtained <em>yet</em> any just ideas
of truth. She had been reading Dr. Tholück's reply
to Strauss's 'Life of Jesus,' but said Mr. Watts had
advised her <em>not</em> to read his 'Guido and Julius.'"</p>

<p>In answer to this my brother says, in a letter dated
Hallé, September 26, 1842, "You have given, doubtless,
a very accurate account of Miss Evans's mode of
stating her present sentiments. Mr. Watts's reason
for advising that Dr. Tholück's 'Guido and Julius' be
not read is, perhaps, that the reasoning is not satisfactory."</p>

<p>In another letter, addressed to my brother at Hallé,
and dated October 28, 1842, I tell him: "Last week
mother and I spent an evening with Miss Evans.
She seemed more settled in her views than ever, and
rests her objections to Christianity on this ground,
that Calvinism is Christianity, and, this granted, that it
is a religion based on pure selfishness. She occupied,
however, a great part of the time in pleading for
works of imagination, maintaining that they perform
an office for the mind which nothing else can. On
the mention of Shakespeare, she praised him with
her characteristic ardor, was shocked at the idea that
mother should disapprove the perusal of his writings,
and quite distressed lest, through her influence, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
should be prevented from reading them. She could
be content were she allowed no other book than
Shakespeare; and in educating a child, this would be
the first book she would place in its hands.</p>

<p>"She seems to have read a great deal of Italian
literature, and speaks with rapture of Metastasio's
novels. She has lent me '<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Le mie Prigioni</span>' di Silvio
Pellico, in his own tongue, as a book to begin with.
She says there is a prevailing but very mistaken idea
that Italian is an easy language, though she is exceedingly
delighted with it. If at any time I wish to begin
German, she would very much like to give me
some instruction."</p>

<p>In addition to the above relating to Shakespeare,
I recall the protest that my mother's objection to his
plays (my mother <em>had</em> been an ardent lover of "the
play"), on the ground that there were things in them
that offended her, was as reasonable as the objection
to walk in a beautiful garden, "because toads and
weeds are to be found in it."</p>

<p>In a letter dated March 6, 1843, I write to my
brother: "Your request that you may be informed as
to the precise nature of Miss Evans's philosophical
views I shall find it very difficult to comply with, inasmuch
as on our last interview she did not express
herself so fully on this subject as formerly; indeed, I
believe she is not now so desirous of controversy.
She however appeared, to me at least, to have rather
changed her ground on some points. For instance,
she said she considered Jesus Christ as the embodiment
of perfect love, and seemed to be leaning slightly
to the doctrines of Carlyle and Emerson when she
remarked that she considered the Bible a revelation
in a certain sense, as she considered herself a revelation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
of the mind of Deity, etc. She was very anxious
to know if you had heard Schelling."</p>

<p>In a letter addressed to my brother at Spring Hill
College, and dated October 28, 1844, I find this
reference to Dr. Harris, who had been preaching a
charity sermon in a chapel at Foleshill:</p>

<p>"Miss Evans has just been reproaching me for not
informing her of Dr. Harris's preaching, which she
would have given anything to hear, as she says his
'Great Teacher' left more delightful impressions on
her mind than anything she ever read, and is, she
thinks, the best book that could be written by a man
holding his principles."</p>

<p>In the same letter I mention a second lesson in German
given me by Miss Evans. In one written some
time before, I tell my brother of her kind proposal,
but add that my parents object "on account of her
dangerous sentiments." She had, however, since called
at our house one morning to renew it: and I well remember
how eagerly I watched my mother, looking so
affectionately at Miss Evans, and saying quietly, "You
know, with your superior intellect, I cannot help fearing
you might influence Mary, though you might not
intend to do so. But," she went on to say, "her father
does not agree with me: he does not see any danger,
and thinks we ought not to refuse, as it is so very kind
of you to be willing to take the trouble&mdash;and we know
it would be a great advantage to her to learn German;
for she will probably have to earn her living by teaching."
Seeing at a glance how matters stood, Miss
Evans turned round quickly to me, and said, "Come
on Saturday at three o'clock, and bring what books
you have."</p>

<p>So I went, and began "Don Carlos," continuing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
go, with some intervals occasioned by absence, pretty
regularly on Saturday afternoons, for nearly two years;
but it was not until the end of the second year, when I
received Miss Evans's suggestion that the lessons were
no longer necessary, and should be discontinued, that I
fully realized what this companionship had been to me.
The loss was like the loss of sunshine.</p>

<p>No promise had been given that my religious belief
should be undisturbed, nor was any needed. Interest
was turned aside from Calvinism and Arminianism,
which at an early age had engaged my attention, towards
manifestations of nobility of character, and sympathy
with human struggles and sufferings under varied
conditions. The character of the "Marquis von Posa"
(in "Don Carlos") roused an enthusiasm for heroism
and virtue, which it was delightful to express to one
who so fully shared it. Placing together one day the
works of Schiller, which were in two or three volumes,
Miss Evans said, "Oh, if <em>I</em> had given these to the world,
how happy I should be!"</p>

<p>It must have been to confirm myself in my traditional
faith by confession of it, that I once took upon myself
to say to her how sure I was that there could be no
true morality without evangelical belief. "Oh, it is so,
is it?" she said, with the kindest smile, and nothing
further passed. From time to time, however, her reverence
and affection for the character of Christ and the
Apostle Paul, and her sympathy with genuine religious
feeling, were very clear to me. Expressing one day
her horror of a crowd, she said, "I never would press
through one, unless it were to see a second Jesus."
The words startled me&mdash;the conception of Jesus Christ
in my mind being so little associated with a human
form; but they impressed me with a certain reality of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
feeling which I contrasted, as I did Miss Evans's abiding
interest in great principles, with the somewhat factitious
and occasional as well as fitful affection and
concern manifest in many whom I looked up to as
"converted" people.</p>

<p>Once only do I remember such contrast being made
by herself. She attended the service at the opening
of a new church at Foleshill, with her father, and remarked
to me the next day that, looking at the gayly
dressed people, she could not help thinking how much
easier life would be to her, and how much better she
should stand in the estimation of her neighbors, if only
she could take things as they did, be satisfied with outside
pleasures, and conform to the popular beliefs
without any reflection or examination. Once, too, after
being in the company of educated persons "professing
and calling themselves Christians," she commented to
me on the <em>tone</em> of conversation, often frivolous, sometimes
ill-natured, that seemed yet to excite in no one
any sense of impropriety.</p>

<p>It must have been in those early days that she spoke
to me of a visit from one of her uncles in Derbyshire,
a Wesleyan, and how much she had enjoyed talking
with him, finding she could enter into his feelings so
much better than she had done in past times, when
her views seemed more in accordance with his own,
but were really less so.</p>

<p>Among other books, I remember the "Life of Dr.
Arnold" interested her deeply. Speaking of it to me
one morning, she referred to a conversation she had
had with a friend the evening before, and said they had
agreed that it was a great good for such men to remain
within the pale of orthodoxy, that so they might draw
from the old doctrines the best that was to be got from
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>Of criticisms on German books read with Miss Evans,
I recall one or two. In the "Robbers," she criticised
the attempt to enhance the horror of the situation of
the abandoned father, by details of physical wretchedness,
as a mistake in Art. "Wallenstein" she ranked
higher from an intellectual point of view than any other
work of Schiller's. The talk of the soldiers in the
"Lager" she pointed out to me as "just what it would
be." On my faint response, "I suppose it is!" she
returned, "No, you do not <em>suppose</em>&mdash;we <em>know</em> these
things;" and then gave me a specimen of what might
be a navvy's talk&mdash;"The sort of thing such people say,
is, 'I'll break off your arm, and bloody your face with
the stump.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bray tells the following incident, as showing
her quick perception of excellence from a new and unknown
source. "We were sitting," Mrs. Bray says,
"one summer afternoon on the lawn at Rosehill, July,
1850, when Marian came running to us from the house
with the <cite>Leader</cite> newspaper in her hand. 'Here is a
new poet come into the world!' she exclaimed, and
sitting down with us she read from the <cite>Leader</cite> the poem
called 'Hymn,' signed M., and ending with the fine
stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'When I have passed a nobler life in sorrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have seen rude masses grow to fulgent spheres;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen how To-day is father of To-morrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And how the Ages justify the Years,<br /></span>
<span class="i24">I praise Thee, God.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The 'Hymn' is now reprinted in Mr. W. M. W.
Call's volume of collected poems, called 'Golden Histories.'"</p>

<p>Kingsley's "Saint's Tragedy" was not so popular
as his other works, but Miss Evans was deeply moved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
by it. Putting it into my hands one morning, she said,
"There, read it&mdash;<em>you</em> will care for it."</p>

<p>The "Life of Jean Paul Richter," published in the
Catholic Series (in which the head of Christ, by De la
Roche, so dear to her, figures as a vignette), was read
and talked of with great interest, as was his "Flower,
Fruit, and Thorn Pieces," translated by the late Mr.
Edward Noel of Hampstead. Choice little bits of humor
from the latter she greatly enjoyed.</p>

<p>Margaret Fuller's "Woman in the Nineteenth Century,"
I think Miss Evans gave to me. I know it interested
her, as did Emerson's "Essays." On his visit
to Coventry, we could not, unfortunately, accept Mr.
Bray's kind invitation to meet him at Rosehill; but after
he had left, Miss Evans soon came up kindly to give us
her impressions of him while they were fresh in her
memory. She told us he had asked her what had first
awakened her to deep reflection, and when she answered,
"Rousseau's Confessions," he remarked that
this was very interesting, inasmuch as Carlyle had told
him that very book had had the same effect upon his
mind. As <em>I</em> heard Emerson's remark after his interviews
with Miss Evans, it was, "That young lady has a calm,
clear spirit." Intercourse, it will be seen, was kept up
with my family, otherwise than through the lessons, by
calls, and in little gatherings of friends in evenings,
when we were favored to hear Miss Evans sing. Her
voice was not strong, and I think she preferred playing
on the piano; but her low notes were effective, and
there was always an elevation in the rendering.</p>

<p>As I knew Miss Evans, no one escaped her notice.
In her treatment of servants, for instance, she was most
considerate. "They come to me," she used to say,
"with all their troubles," as indeed did her friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
generally&mdash;sometimes, she would confess, to an extent
that quite oppressed her. When any object of charity
came under her notice, and power to help was within
her reach, she was very prompt in rendering it. Our
servant's brother or sister, or both of them, died, leaving
children dependent on friends themselves poor.
Miss Evans at once offered to provide clothing and
school-fees for one of these, a chubby-faced little girl
four or five years of age. Unexpectedly, however, an
aunt at a distance proposed to adopt the child. I
recollect taking her to say good-bye to her would-be
benefactress, and can see her now, standing still and
subdued in her black frock and cape, with Miss Evans
kneeling down by her, and saying, after giving her
some money, "Then I suppose there is nothing else
we can do for her."</p>

<p>My husband's mother, who was a member of the
Society of Friends, established, with the help of her
daughters and a few others interested, an Industrial
Home for girls about the age of fourteen. It was in
the year 1843, and was, therefore, one of the first institutions
of the kind in England. The model was taken
from something of the same order attempted by a
young girl in France. The girls were, as far as practicable,
to maintain themselves, working under conditions
of comfort and protection more attainable than
in their own homes. The idea was new; the Home
could not be started without funds, and my mother
undertook to collect for it in her own neighborhood.
In a letter to me, written at this time, she tells me she
is "not doing much to help dear Mrs. Cash," there
being "a prejudice against the scheme;" but adds,
"This morning Miss Evans called, and brought me
two guineas from her father." I tell of this as one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
among many indications of Miss Evans's ever-growing
zeal to serve humanity in a broader way, motived, as
<em>she</em> felt, by a higher aim than what she termed "desire
to save one's soul by making up coarse flannel for the
poor."</p>

<p>In these broad views&mdash;in this desire to bring her
less advantaged neighbors nearer to her own level, to
meet them on common ground, to raise them above
the liability to eleemosynary charity&mdash;she had Mr.
Bray's full sympathy. To me she dwelt frequently
upon his genuine benevolence, upon his ways of advancing
the interests of the working men, as being, in
her judgment, wise and good. She visited periodically,
in turn with Mrs. Bray, myself, and a few others,
an infant school which Mr. Bray had helped to start;
and although this sort of work was so little suited to
her, yet so much did she feel the duty of living for
others, especially the less privileged, that one morning
she came to Mrs. Bray, expressing strongly her desire
to help in <em>any</em> work that could be given her. The
only thing that could be thought of was the illustration
of some lessons in Natural History, on sheets of cardboard,
needed then, when prints of the kind were not
to be procured for schools. The class of animals to
be illustrated by Mrs. Bray on the sheet taken by Miss
Evans was the "Rodentiæ," and at the top a squirrel
was to figure, the which she undertook to draw. This
I have seen, half-finished&mdash;a witness to the willing
mind; proof that its proper work lay otherwhere.
Lectures at the Mechanics' Institute were matters of
great interest to Miss Evans; and I remember the
pleasure given her by the performance of the music of
"Comus," with lecture by Professor Taylor, at our old
St. Mary's Hall. In that hall, too, we heard the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
lecture on total abstinence that I remember to have
heard in Coventry, though of "Temperance Societies"
we knew something. The lecturer was the Rev. Mr.
Spencer, a clergyman at Hinton Charterhouse, near
Bath, and uncle of Mr. Herbert Spencer. Miss Evans
was present at the lecture, with Mr. Bray, who told me
afterwards he had some difficulty in restraining her
from going up, as soon as the lecture was over, to take
the pledge, he thought, without due consideration. "I
felt," she said, speaking to me afterwards of the lecturer,
"that he had got hold of a power for good that
was of incalculable worth."</p>

<p>I need scarcely say that I received, along with lessons
in German, some "rules and lessons for life"
from Miss Evans. One of the first was an injunction
to be accurate, enforced with the warning that the
tendency is to grow less and less so as we get older.
The other was tolerance. How well I can remember
the remonstrance, "My dear child, the great lesson of
life is tolerance." In the proverb, "Live and let live,"
she saw a principle involved, harder to act upon, she
would say, than the maxims of benevolence&mdash;I think,
because bringing less credit with it.</p>

<p>The reading of dramas and romances naturally gives
rise to discussion of their main theme. In treating of
love and marriage, Miss Evans's feeling was so fine as
to satisfy a young girl in her teens, with her impossible
ideals. The conception of the union of two persons
by so close a tie as marriage, without a previous union
of minds as well as hearts, was to her dreadful. "How
terrible it must be," she once said to me, "to find one's
self tied to a being whose limitations you could see,
and must know were such as to prevent your ever being
understood!" She thought that though in England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
marriages were not professedly "arrangés," they were
so too often practically: young people being brought
together, and receiving intimations that mutual interest
was desired and expected, were apt to drift into connections
on grounds not strong enough for the wear
and tear of life; and this, too, among the middle as
well as in the higher classes. After speaking of these
and other facts, of how things were and would be, in
spite of likelihood to the contrary, she would end by
saying, playfully, "Now, remember I tell you this, and
I am sixty!"</p>

<p>She thought the stringency of laws rendering the
marriage-tie (at that date) irrevocable, practically worked
injuriously; the effect being "that many wives took
far less pains to please their husbands in behavior and
appearance, because they knew their own position to
be invulnerable." And at a later time she spoke of
marriages on the Continent, where separations did not
necessarily involve discredit, as being very frequently
far happier.</p>

<p>One claim, as she regarded it, from equals to each
other was this, the right to hear from the aggrieved,
"You have ill-treated me; do you not see your conduct
is not fair, looked at from my side?" Such frankness
would, she said, bring about good understanding
better than reticent endurance. Her own filial piety
was sufficiently manifest; but of the converse obligation,
that of the claim of child upon parent, she was
wont to speak thus strongly. "There may be," she
would say, "conduct on the part of a parent which
should exonerate his child from further obligation to
him; but there cannot be action conceivable which
should absolve the parent from obligation to serve his
child, seeing that for that child's existence he is himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
responsible." I did not at the time see the connection
between this view and the change of a fundamental
nature marked by Miss Evans's earlier contention
for our "claim on God." The bearing of the
above on orthodox religion I did not see. Some time
ago, however, I came across this reflection, made by a
clergyman of the Broad Church school&mdash;that since the
<em>claims</em> of children had, in the plea for schools, been
based on the responsibility of parents towards them, a
higher principle had been maintained on the platform
than was preached from the pulpit, as the basis of the
popular theology.</p>

<p>In my previous communication in the "Life" I have
already made mention of Miss Evans's sympathy with
me in my own religious difficulties; and my obligations
to her were deepened by her seconding my resolve to
acknowledge how much of the traditional belief had
fallen away from me and left a simpler faith. In this
I found her best help when, as time passed on, my
brother saw he could not conscientiously continue in
the calling he had chosen. As, however, his heresies
were not considered fatal, and he was esteemed by the
professors and students of his college, there was for
some time hesitation. In this predicament I wrote to
him, a little favoring compromise. My mother also
wrote. I took the letters to Miss Evans before posting
them. She read mine first, with no remark, and
then began my mother's, reading until she came upon
these words&mdash;"In the meantime, let me entreat you
not to utter any sentiments, either in the pulpit or in
conversation, that you do not believe to be strictly
true;" on which she said, turning to me, "Look, this
is the important point, what your mother says here,"
and I immediately put my own letter into the fire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
"What are you doing?" she quickly said; and when I
answered, "You are right&mdash;my mother's letter is to the
point, and that only need go," she nodded assent, and,
keeping it, sent it enclosed with a few lines from herself.</p>

<p>I knew what I had done and so did she: the giving
up of the ministry to a young man without other resources
was no light matter; and as I rose to go she
said, "These are the tragedies for which the world
cares so little, but which are so much to me."</p>

<p>More than twenty years elapsed before I had again
the privilege of seeing George Eliot, and that on one
occasion only, after her final settlement in London. It
touched me deeply to find how much she had retained
of her kind interest in all that concerned me and
mine, and I remarked on this to Mr. Lewes, who came
to the door with my daughter and myself at parting.
"Wonderful sympathy," I said. "Is it not?" said
he; and when I added, inquiringly, "The power lies
there?" "Unquestionably it does," was his answer;
"she forgets nothing that has ever come within the
curl of her eyelash; above all, she forgets no one who
has ever spoken to her one kind word."</p>
